So.
So, for you, if there were housing built on that  in the neighborhood,  do you feel that-  that  the people who should move in  to the new housing sounds like should be  local-  local residents, or the children of-  of other folks, I mean who sho- I guess I'm asking, who should that housing be for?
Hm.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Right.

What do you think about building height?

For you  Buy the air rights of it.
I'd um.
Yeah.
It's not So, do you di- do you think the- though that given the fact that that land, in particular has been vacant for forty years, people fight over it, I mean do you think that there's a possibility for it to-  for people to reach a compromise somehow?
You know, the fights have been over  the type of housing, you know, just what you're saying, you know.
What does affordable mean?
Some people want all, some people wanna build luxury  condos, and they can't-  they can't seem to agree.

Lemme ask you about the Lower East Side as a neighborhood.
So, first of all, what, uh, where are the boundaries for you of the Lower East Side?
Well, like geographic boundaries.
Brooklyn Bridge.

That's a big.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And there are some people that  that view  north of Houston Street  As a separate s- East Village.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Right.
So, uh, so if we have  these boundaries for the Lower East side, um,  who makes up  the Lower East Side community, is it everybody who lives within those streets?
Lives and works.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I, I guess I should ask  how you define community, right?
Like what does it mean to be a part of a community?

Mm-hm.
Do you think that it's important for us and for the- those people who are new to- to really understand the history of the neighborhood?
Kind of in order to move forward, I guess, do we need to know about the past?
