S- so was it the whole state, or was it just some of it?
Real New Orleans.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
That's discouraging,  to hear.
But you know I'm always pro,  um,  what's the word?
Conspiracy theory and shit.
And I feel like that was definitely  something folks was mentioning, but, you know, kind of got swept to the side a little bit.
Hm.
Do you feel like  it's any possible way that, um, somebody breaking the levees would  possibly help that situation  at that time?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
That's very very interesting.
I don't know how deep of your New O-  New Orleans knowledge you got, but, you know, I'm'a at least ask, see if I can learn something out of this joint.
Um,  let's-  we gonna double back to  N-O right quick.
Let's get to the G-A part.
So, um,  you was done with, um, s-  school like grade school  when you, um,  before you got to Atlanta, right?
Mm.
So how was that transition from moving to N-O to Georgia?
You don't got no friends from  high school or,  you know,  shit like that.
How did you, um,  adjust?
Did you have family down here?
Mm.
Mm.
Okay.
So the vibe,  shoo okay.

Mm-hm.
That's cool.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
I think that's a real,  real great point.
So-  so sauce,  swag,  what would be another word for that?

Because  niggas in the A  kind of understand  this is really the culture whether you rapping about it or not.
You talking like this, and this is going on, you know,  the Migos kind of just really highlighting some shit we done already known.
or just, able to highlight the shit first  that's really-  you know, and I get that with the culture, you know, type shit going, i- it kind of bring even more meaning  to my eyes i- in that type of way, like  niggas be-  been saying  dabbed, and pipe- pipe it up, pipe it up, lit.
All sorts of shit for a long time, so  they got a new song on that bitch.
Walk it like I talk it,   walk it like I talk it,  See I ain't even have to say that.

What about DG Yola?
Is he still alive?
He might be.
Yeah.
I feel like somebody was saying that he died, but then he wasn't actually dead, but I don't know.
You probably woulda seen that nigga resurface by now.

Like a lot of these lingos niggas be bringing out rap- it's some older- older rappers been saying that shit OutKast been said that trash.

Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
That's why we need to change the word for trap to mean something else like freedom or something, but maybe not that, but something- Now, just- I'm'a stop you right there cause that's how I'm feeling about cap, if I don't know the real meaning of it.
