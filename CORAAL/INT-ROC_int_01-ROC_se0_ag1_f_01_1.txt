So yeah, I just,  uh, tell people,  um,  pretty much that  the questions are open ended.
Feel free to respond, you know, how you would like and um, tell stories or  there's no right or wrong answer, it's just-  Yeah it's just whatever your experiences were, you know,  uh, I'm interested in.
If you see me look down, it's just to make sure that this is still recording.
But you can still keep talking, like you don't have to pause or anything.
Um,  let's see,  and then the last thing I always ask at the beginning is, if you consent  for, uh, doing this interview.
Okay,  great.
Gotta get that verbal  consent, that's essential.
Okay, great, so,  I usually like to start off the conversation with, um,    asking where you are from in the city of Rochester.
Where did you grow up?
Mm-hm.
So how long, um, have you lived over there, or do your parents still live there?
Yup, me too.
Yeah, so you described the neighborhood a little bit, uh, but can you elaborate maybe say,  uh, the demographics and, Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay cool.
And so, um, you said it was family oriented, so you played outside a lot with the kids on the street and- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, cool, and, um, did you play at any, I guess rec centers, maybe, occasionally, or?
No, okay.
Yeah.
Okay,  so would you say that, um, you grew up then as a westsider?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, for someone who's not from here, how would you characterize west side from east side?
Yeah.
Cool, cool, no, yeah.
That's good, I want your opinion, so.
That's good, okay, what schools did you go to?
Ah, okay.
That's good, did you start RD-SCHOOL-2 in high school or middle school?
Mm.
Yeah, okay.
And, um,  did you start off in dance in middle school too, or?
Okay.
Yeah Okay, we- we got to .
Yeah, actually it's so funny cause my niece is going to her, uh, uh, orientation for the middle school program today, so.
Yeah I think they have like the same kind of structure where like you- Mm-hm.
Right exactly, so- Yeah, cause they switch around so much, seven through twelve, six to twelfth, yup.
yeah.
Okay, and how would you characterize your time at RD-SCHOOL-2?
Hm.
Yeah.
Me too.
I th- I think that it's, um, of the city schools, you know, one of the best.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Uh, RD-NAME-2?
Oh, maybe not.
Maybe not cause I think she's still there, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
No, I think I can totally relate.
I mean going to the RD-SCHOOL-3, I don't feel like I had the education to keep up with those other kids.
Everybody had AP everything.
Everything, you know, I took like, one or two APs.
Yeah, they didn't tell me, and on top of that, I'm just like, well if I don't think I can get a A in it, I don't wanna take it, which is not a great mindset to have, right?
Like, just, whatever I can get a A in, whatever's easy.
But yeah, so I definitely felt that way when I went to RD-SCHOOL-3.
Mm.
Mm-hm, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
No, I completely agree.
I mean, I ended up making it,  but it was-  Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, but I do feel like having the major definitely prepared me in a different kind of way.
You know, like- Yeah, and like time management and knowing you had stuff that was just kind of like requirements, but things that you had to satisfy for your discipline.
Yeah, I like that part of it I guess.
So, where did you, um, apply to school when y- first out of like, RD-SCHOOL-2?
Aw, really?
Mm.
Yay, congrats.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, after you get your RN, cause we know that's gonna happen- Yes we're gonna claim that.
Do you think you'll stay in Rochester?
Yeah.
That name sounds extremely familiar,  Probably.
You have time.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm,  and do you travel a lot now, or?
So where have you been?
Mm-hm.
Oh, no, you don't  Mm-hm.
So is there anywhere you've been where you feel like, you know, this feels like an- it could be another home for me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's turn this up some more.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Well, um,  how long is your RN program?
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Cool.
Awesome.
Well, um,   okay,  cool.
Um,   what-  I wanna turn to some questions actually, um, more about Rochester in general.
Um,  what are your favorite things to do here?
Or about here, about Rochester in general, I can- Yeah, okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
So Rochester then isn't like a great place for young, black millennials?
Mm.
Yeah, so you feel like, uh, you're not like, I guess racialized in the same sort of way as you would be in those sorts of places.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And do you think that Rochester is, uh, segregated?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
So what would- what do you think would need to happen to fix the circumstances I guess that they're gonna enter into, and to also get more like young black millennials to want to stay in Rochester?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay, so,  we've talked a little bit about, uh, segregation as well as like, um,  and how it  kind of is more so by economic,  um, circumstances.
Um,  h- what is your take on, I guess,  diversity here in Rochester?
Do you think this is a diverse place to live?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah,   I agree.
I think it is  different across the city, but  also too, um,  I think it's interesting because  w- I feel like we interact with,  you know, people in the suburbs all the time cause that's where our grocery stores are.
That's where any t- kind of commerce, right.
And business dealings happen, and they don't happen actually in our- downtown.
Yet, you know, they have more of a choice as to whether or not  they want to interact with city  residents.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it would make sense that, you know, the girl in your class  would say something like that about shootings in Rochester if you  really have no  kind of, um,  interaction with- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
So, um, my last, uh, question usually revolves around language stuff, and so- or f- couple questions, because I mean we started talking about this a little bit before, but first I'll start off on, um,    do you perceive, or has anyone ever told you  that you have  a Rochesterian accent?
Yeah.
The New York thing, I could   see a little bit more, because it's like, that's  mostly to me sounding like  using certain like  lexical  things, like saying son and whatever, like that's how people-  But the southern thing, to me,  is harder to understand what people  mean by southern.
Like, is it the way I pronounce certain words?
Mm-hm.
What part of the South are your, uh,  folks from?
Yeah.
Right.
So many of our family members are from the South, and so I also wonder how much that feeds in too.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Now do the people in like, say for instance, your program, do, uh, like the white girls in your program, or men too,  um,   shouldn't just gender it,  but  do they- do you think that  the people who live like in the suburbs sound different  from- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Well, yeah or their culture is the default.
You know, like, it's just the way things are  considered to be normal or way of life kind of, maybe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, you brought up- uh, know, um, we were talking right before the interview sort of about this, talking white versus talking black.
When you get comme- comments about, uh,  you sound white maybe, who do you get them from?
Mm.
You turn it on and off, right?
Like, and  some people, I guess may turn it on and off more than others.
Um, uh, but whether or not, you know, you're speaking what I- what I guess I- we would call African American English, um, or not like, you know, you're all capable of- um,  of complex thought.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, well, um,    those are all the questions that I have, but if you have any last thoughts, um,  that you'd like to say about Rochester, or-  or anything we talked about,  you know.
Nah, you did good.
It's been, you know, really fascinating and interesting, so thank you.
I always ask at the end, you know, are you, um, comfortable with me still using this interview?
Okay, cool.
You don't sound crazy.
