And your birthday?
Please.
Awesome.
Where were you born?
What neighborhood do you claim?
Mk- Mkay.
Um, have you ever lived in DC proper?
Okay.
And where do you stay?
Mm-hm.
I know, y- yup.
Where'd you go to school?
Hm.
And what do you do?
Do you love it?
I can imagine.
I used to work at a bridal shop,  um, and I just love- I love that aspect of it.
Um, and I'm not a  super detail detail orient person, I could never probably do events.
But I love getting them ready and hearing about their big day.
And so they would bring in little things to talk about it, and I'm just like, oh my god I love this.
Mm.
So what- uh, and this is not e- we not even in the question section yet, but what got you into- Mm-hm.
Is she the quote in your e-mail?
Is that the testimonial?
Right.
Ever.
Wow.
Um,  okay so we're gonna talk a lot more about that cause I think that's amazing, and I'm sure you have some crazy stories.
Um, where were your parents born?
Okay they both were.
And that's what I- You said they grew up there so I was wondering if they were born there as well.
And what do your parents do?
Mm-hm.
I do mm-hm, construction everywhere.
What does your mom do?
Okay.
Excellent.
I think that's all I have for right now on  the writing piece.
So, tell me a little bit about    growing up.
So you moved out.
So you were in Alexandria but you p- you were really little.
And-  or Arlington, so then you moved to Temple Hills but that's probably what you remember.
Put it out there.
Put it out th- I love it.
Mm.
Oh wow.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
yes.
Mm.
Yup.
Hm.
Mm.
Come on in.
Come on in.
Mm.
What do you do with the-  what do you do with the people though that are getting pushed out?
How should they feel?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Push back.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm not gonna live there, I'm not going there.
What happens when it moves to east of the river?
No that's-  in fact I work- um,  I work over there.
Outside of  school here I work  over, um,  at RD-WORK-4 on Benning Road.
So every day I  drive by   Shrimp Boat.
It's got a facelift.
That ain't Shrimp Boat.
Um,  the condos right there.
They're adding in that right from- across from Dorothy Height Library.
Where'd this come from?
Then corner of Minnesota and Benning.
W-  what is this?
It- it doesn't fit,  right?
It- not to say that they can't fix the area up, but fix it up where it's- it's authentically  present and it makes sense.
Not- don't put, you know, a Christmas tree- Just to make sure it's- I saw.
My- my cousin put one up on his page.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Right.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
That's a interesting perspective.
So,  what's something that you can do on the inside?
Mm.
Right.
Do you think-   So you said you're a Lyft driver, is that-  is it fun?
But that's the perception, right?
That's- People think that it's- w- I think there's two reasons, right?
B- one, I think because- because there's the DC of CNN,  and there's the real DC right?
Because once you walk outside of three or four blocks, it's not like that.
And so,  once people are here and they see that they're like, oh wait I've been deceived all my life cause it's not that way.
And the second thing is because you get the myth that there are no people from DC.
And so when you meet somebody who's from DC or even from this area that grew up in this area,  wait I didn't think there was anybody from here, so now li- like, there must be a story.
So when you have those two things coming together, like, oh my g- there has to be some amazing crazy story that happened to you.
Did you have like, playtime at the White House every day?
Did you- You know, I mean, like it has to be something crazy, like, right?
Did you have like- I don't know.
But people in their minds make up this big whole thing like, dude I just  did the same shit you did, like- like that's just kind of how it- But in their minds because- because  these other factors come into play, you-  it becomes this whole thing.
How'd you- how did- how did we- I mean, I know how we got connected but how did  you and RD-NAME-1 start talking to get-  to get us here to this point?
Which is totally different.
No, it's been-  Just to hear-  So I'm really interested in how people think about DC.
And to hear your thoughts on DC and the way you've  painted the picture and thinking about how people think about  the change has been absolutely amazing.
Like,  um,    different,  um,  and  I have just really enjoyed it.
Because I think-  I think one, sometimes either- And you're young, like we're almost the same age.
And I think- But you've seen a lot of things, one with Lyft but I also think  being-  And your whole thing about you love the millennials coming in, meeting at the bar.
and getting married.
Because I think that shows that  instead of being upset with the system, make the system work for you.
And that's one of the things I tell  k- I work with kids.
All the time like, don't get mad at the game, play it, and win.
Like people get mad at the game because they don't- they aren't good at it.
That's the only reason you get mad at it because you don't know how to play.
Like if you're playing scrapple with monoboly-  playing Scrabble with Monopoly money you're gonna lose every day of the week.
But as soon as you get you some scrapple- some Scrabble tiles you're gonna start winning cause you're gonna start making words, and you're gonna start getting those points just like everybody else.
But when people don't know how to play the game- Mm.
Yup.
And using that advantage.
So tell me how you- Okay so, talked about the wedding, what has been your craziest w-  experience in the whole wedding planning business?
That's- that's too much for her.
Doing what they're supposed to do.
