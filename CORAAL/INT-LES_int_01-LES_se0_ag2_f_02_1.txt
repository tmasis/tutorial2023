What did you play as a kid?
Where did you play?
First of all.
Because in Baruch, you have playgrounds.
So, you played there in the park?
You guys were so lucky, because a lot of kids lived on a block with tenements, and so they just played in the street.
And you guys have parks everywhere.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The big park.
I heard that.
Yeah.

So you were really politically aware, at a- even at a- at a young age.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know you talked about some racial tensions and I know that, you know, there have been times in-  in the neighborhood that have been sort of higher crime than others.
I mean, was that something that  i-  you experienced that  affected you directly?
Did you s- did you see-  did you see violence?
Was it something you sort of  had to deal with?
Right.
Yeah.
It hit hard.

Why they turned to.
Right.
So, tell me um, quickly, your schooling history.
You went to school in the neighborhood?
Uh-huh.
Uh-oh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, a leap.
To  two grades.
Look at you.
Um.
Uptown.
Mm-hm.
I literally just interviewed another girl who went there.
She's younger than you, you probably didn't know her.
But, she was telling me about it.
She said it was huge.
I didn't realize how big it was.
Oh my God.
That's so amazing.
Yeah.
So, you did dance, right?

Learn some tools for Right.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
That's really tough.
So, let me ask you a little bit about um,  your opinions about  how the neighborhood has changed in the time that you've  seen it.
I know you don't live here anymore, but you obviously come back and you spend your time here.
How do you sort of see  what's been happening here?
I know.
Right.
I remember that.
I mean, I wasn't here, but I remember that.
And they came in hard to  get the drug dealers.
Right?
We- well.
Right.
Right.
There was like a period where they were like, this is now where we're gonna you know.
Is it really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And not for.
Yeah.
I think it is the largest, I think.
Is it?
It's huge.
It's huge.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or they may not realize how to do that.
How to go about doing that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's more of a class thing right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The night life.
Yeah.
It's that way.
That's funny.
So, let me ask you, um, because I wanna understand, um,  but first, I have to ask you.
what do you think are the boundaries of the Lower East Side?
Like geographically.
Where  the streets.
How it- Yeah.
For you.
Cause everybody has a different.
Yeah and they think it's like a di- you know, goes from here to here.
What is it for you?
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
Yeah.
Yup .
Like Brooklyn Bridge.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's your take on that.
Some people think there's- there's  now two separate neighborhoods, like, the Lower East Side and the East Village.
Yeah.
East Village is- is like a and that name is like a real estate  invention.
It's new, you know.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
So, we got this huge neighborhood, right, with these  big boundaries.
So,  do all people that live inside those streets  do they form one Lower East Side  community?
And I guess to- for you to answer that, I have to ask you, like what does  community mean to you?
Like wha- how do you define that?
What does it mean?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot.
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
Okay.
And what about all these new people moving in?
Are they a part of The Lower East Side community?
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool.
Cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Yeah.
It's a- everything's great.
Even on Pitt Street, I- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah .
And could those two groups come together?
I'm- not even just coexist.
I mean, can they- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who-  Who does that?
I jus- I know.
They're so- I just don't understand where they're coming from.
Like, there's just so ma- seems to be so many of them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know, it's insane.
It's completely insane.
Yeah.
Yeah.
About to play.
Good for them.
Oh.
Right.
A cool place to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
Okay, so let me ask your opinions about housing and development and in particular, because one issue that like, RD-NAME-2 and GOALS and me are work- are working on is this um.
Uh.
The parking lots that are just south of Delancey on- by the Williamsburg bridge, t- you're familiar with those.
It's a urban renewal site.
And  if you know, it's been vacant for ever.
So, forty years.
Um.
Really?
So,  uh, I always ask people,  it's a huge area of land, I think it's the-  the biggest area, undeveloped, you know, in Manhattan, south of Ninety-Sixth Street or something.
If it were up to you,  blank slate.
What would you wanna see developed in a big plot of land like that, in the middle of your community?
What do you think is needed  here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hm.
Okay.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's- it's a st- an interesting space.
The- A lot of the issues uh that people not being able to agree has been about housing.
Building housing, and if it were to be built, Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
So, what- sort of, what's your take on that?
Like, do you think there should be- there needs to be housing built  in the community?
And then, if so, for who?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Because you- because you weren't able to Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, do you like, um, models that are-  are all low income?
or like mi- a mix- like mixed housing.
That's sort of a newer  concept.
Like, you put low, moderate, and middle,  all in the same complex.
Which one of those, like strikes you better?
It should.
Right.
Right.
Right.
It's got to be distributed in the right way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm a student.
I'm definitely low income .
Um.
What about building height?
Also something people really opinionated about.
Do you think that there's something that's too tall for this community?
Like, do you- do you,  think if like, for instance, if that site were gonna be developed, would you  think there is a ca- there should be a cap on how high it goes?
Yeah.
Like all the bars and clubs.
Yeah and yeah and The Extension.
Right.
But something like that would be okay with you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
And you'd be willing to go a-  higher, if it meant more affordable housing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Some of 'em just stick out.
And it's The blue building.
Everyone talks about the blue building.
It's about to tip over .
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, you already mentioned this.
Um.
That the  in the history of the Lower East Side,  it's really been a place where a lot of people move to start  over.
Start fresh, start a new life.
And I'm wondering if you still think it's a place where people can do that.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the people who do need the second chance are- they're not- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Do you think it's important for  uh,  people who move into the neighborhood or even the East, like you were just talking about some of your youth.
Do you think it's important for people to know something about the, like the rich history of this neighborhood?
And does it affect kind of how they relate to their  community?
Cause it really is such a, you know, the kind of the birthplace of activism.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah, totally.
Totally Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Completely.
