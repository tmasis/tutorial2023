What would I do?
I'd be so happy, I don't know what I'd do.
What would I buy?
First  I give my mother  the money cause she'll know what to do with it.
She'll buy me s-  uh, my school clothes and-  and buy what she need, and keep the rest for herself.
Well first,  like  if it be her birthday coming up  when she gave me the money,  and she d-  she forget that it gonna be her birthday,  well I'll go out and buy her a dress  or shoes or a outfit.
I would buy me  m-  buy me something like  pair of pants,  some-  or a shirt or something.
Something that I can use- something not that I can't use.
Something like what?
Did I- Do I have one?
Yes.
Television  too-  color television.
Bicycle.
And um,  uh,  a hi-fi.
Well first,  my mother cook  a  big turkey  and  two- about three cakes  s- and pie.
And she set it up there for Santa Claus  and  and then,  uh- I- e-  she have pean- um-  peanuts and stuff and candy all over the table.
And pa-.
Well, then I go to bed,  but I can't go to sleep.
Then my mother um,  come up there  and have my sister to peep in see if I'm asleep.
I close my eyes and turn my head,  but she know I'm not asleep.
Cause she'll tickle my feet.
I got up  and found a pool table.
Size- this size.
Yep .
Yep.
I like a bike.
A ten speed.
Whatchu mean?
Like um- Like peoples go around, say um, James Bond got shot.
Like,  yeah.
One time they told me  that James Bond got shot.
And it spread all around this um, neighborhood,  and he had to come on TV  and tell everybody that he didn't get shot.
