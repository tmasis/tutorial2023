Yeah, um,  this other flood,  um,  let's see.
Here we go.
I think-  I don't know if this was for the, uh, flood or not.
Serving us- Yeah this might been it.
But they had a- they had a news article on- on that, um- Uh-huh.
Yeah here it is.
Yeah.
Serving up flood relief from a golden platter.
And this was back in, um,  what's the date on this thing?
Yeah this said it's in Princeville two thousand national telethon.
In, uh,  I think that we raised over  one point five million dollars.
Yep.
Uh, it-  it consisted of, um,  of going out and doing a telethon with, um,  RD-NAME-5's company uh, NBC,  which is located in Atlanta, Georgia.
And, uh, Evander Holyfield is one of the board members as well as uh, Marlon Jackson.
So, um, mayor, uh,  RD-NAME-4,  she would, um,  she's- she- she would go down too  with some of her board members.
And, um,  so we'd,  you know, do a telethon, and I think it w- Cox- Cox carried it.
And, uh,  think it was seen in  several  several s- several countries.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Right, and- and Lowe's would give the biggest donation.
I think they would do a million dollars in supplies.
Uh, they help people here build, you know, rebuild back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah I- I would go down and, um,  do one of our songs, w- two songs as a matter of fact,  Only You, which was the greatest song that we would ever do.
And then, uh,  trying to appeal to the, uh, people  that uh, the essence of it was for really the children to rebuild, restore.
And so we would do, uh, an original song  titled Do It For The Kids, that was recorded and produced in Prince Studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,  it was.
Yep.
T- and- and to, uh, meet Evander Holyfield and- and- and to use some of his kids from his, uh, youth club that- that was a- was a thrill in itself.
Yeah.
Well he- he wasn't doing that much talking.
Yeah.
I don't- I don't think he's a talkative person.
And Marlon didn't do that much either.
But, uh, Mr.
Gary, you know, was very, um,  verbal and  supportive in- in the effort of raising funds for the area.
Yeah.
Yep.
Well I would come back here, um,  in the year two thousand  right after the flood.
Yeah because  this house,  the old house that was once here,  was totally underwater.
Uh, it didn't leave the- the foundation,  but uh,  it was just-  it was a mess, you know?
Yeah.
Back in this direction, yeah.
Yeah I was living in, uh, Milwaukee, and, um, doing very well  uh, with my-  my semi retirement in in- in the industry.
And, um,  my two brother- not my- not two brothers- my- my brothers, uh,  their wives and their families, you know, they weren't interested in  relocating, coming back.
And I recalled daddy  saying,  you know, hold on to it.
Hold on to it.
You know, because this was-  this where it all began.
And um-  Yeah hold on to the land, yeah.
Yeah, to the house.
I mean just hold on to the-  to the little seed.
And so uh, I said, well,  I guess it's gonna fall on me, so.
Oh he's always- Yeah he's always instilled that in us, you know,  that, um,  never let it go.
Now I know we- we're talking now, but did you wanna start  chronologically back to nineteen forty or how you- however you wanna do it.
Well you- Uh-huh.
But- Mm-hm.
Yeah- long time.
Uh, it- this land goes f- as far back to the river.
Mm-hm.
Which is over- I would say it's over three, four hundred feet  deep.
But it- we- we can only utilize, um, um, r-  right now  two hundred feet  that's  I call  landscapable, you know, salvageable because you got a- a natural spring that I used to play back there as a child that is still running and so it's infested with, um,  with the crawlers  and, uh-  But I eventually hope to, um-  this fall  I got me a new Poulan  uh, chainsaw.
I'm gonna go back in there and  save a few.
Because you know we have, um, a dyke -  a- a lake back there which was the results  from digging the dyke.
As a- as a preventative, uh, measures for keeping Princeville from being, you know, flooded.
And I think um, local contractor, Mr RD-NAME-2,  RD-NAME-5,  would dig that  and, um,  and would help build  that-  that dyke.
Yeah.
Well, no, they didn't- they didn't dredge the river,  they just dug on this side  of the land.
And they dug a nice beautiful hole s- it's- and they stocked it  with fish.
And so it could be- if it was developed uh, right, it could be a very attractive um,  r- r-  resort area for fishing and a- uh- recreation.
Yep.
I doubt it.
Uh-  at this time of year- No- uh- But no, you can go down here uh,  two doors down, Mr.
RD-NAME-2.
Uh, he- people using his   to get back the fish.
Yeah.
But they- but those guys are crawling out there now, if you know what I'm talking about.
Snakes.
Yeah.
Yeah, there's- that- that has been since I was a kid  um,  have always been uh, snake bed.
And uh, we used to run 'em, man, r- cra- you know, young days, we was crazier.
Used to run 'em .
Catch 'em, and and uh, n-  kill 'em or whatever, just  call ourselves r-  you know, getting rid of 'em.
Yep.
Yeah as a kid.
Now- don't do it now.
Yep.
Here come the wintertime, I'll uh, put on my- my gum boots and uh, get me some help.
And uh,  just go back there and cut down maybe half a dozen or more of the trees and just  let 'em lay and let  Mother Nature take care of 'em.
Yeah.
Yep.
Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.
Mm, no.
Mom and Daddy bought this lot.
But the original property, um, would be over there in Princeville,  right across from, um, the town hall  now.
But before the replaced the town hall, long long time ago as a child, um, Mr.
RD-NAME-3,  who Princeville was named after, his house was right across the street from my grandmom's.
Yeah, and uh, uh, we used to go over there and  play on that porch and under the house.
And y- you know,  got some very v- vivid  and fond memories as a child  on Main Street.
Yeah,  it was a- it was a wonderful place just to- to stay and to live- to- to be raised up, yeah.
The neighborhood, um,  I had all my cronies and by buddies, you know, it was like,  my best- one of my best buddies stayed right next door.
Uh, RD-NAME-6.
And, um- Mm-hm.
And  his mom and dad was raised with my mom and dad.
And also Mr.
RD-NAME-2- you've- you spoke with Mr.
RD-NAME-2 yet?
Well Mr.
RD-NAME-2 and my daddy was raised up.
And I was raised up with his children, RD-NAME-2 and RD-NAME-2.
RD-NAME-7.
As a matter fact, uh, RD-NAME-2 would be  the one  I give her this credit.
And I appreciate it.
But she would  sound the alarm that I was on Johnny Carson show.
Yeah.
She was in Washington DC and she happened to see it  and so she got on the phone and call her mom and call up everybody, say  RD-NAME-4 is on the Johnny Carson show with the Platters!
And they would tell me that later on.
I said, well, RD-NAME-1, if you hadn't told 'em, I said, you know how remote  the area is.
I said, they would have never- and I say, a lot of 'em don't even know it today.
You know?
Uh but uh.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
Um,  RD-NAME-1  RD-NAME-2  and my granddaddy was name RD-NAME-1.
And uh, his daddy was name RD-NAME-2.
Yeah, it was great granddad yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yep.
Uh, RD-NAME-2  and- and uh, Uncle RD-NAME-1, which was my great, great, great uncle, they would, um,  have this property  adjacent  to  Princeville old school.
Him and uh,  I think it was Miss RD-NAME-4, which was um, my great uncle's uh, wife of course.
Uh, I used to go over there and eat  uh, during lunch time.
Yeah.
So and  the story that I used to hear about  that- that,  great granddaddy  um,  was one of the few that got the forty acres and the mule.
Yeah.
Yep.
It- Well, so it- what- what they were called reparations.
Yeah.
As a- as appreciation of-  of the abuse or the- the f- the free slave labor.
So you familiar with reparation?
NCOBRA?
N'-  You familiar with NCOBRA?
Okay.
That's the acronym for the National Coalition of Reparation.
Yeah.
Yeah.
NCOBRA?
No, it- it- That's the current organization that's pushing uh, the uh, HR bill forty.
Yeah.
And, um,  they're trying to get um, Congress to um-  to do a study on uh- on slavery.
And uh, the post trauma  and how it um-  how it would effect-  the people  as a whole.
And um,  and we- you- and you'd be surprised how many, um,  Caucasian supporters- I call 'em my Caucasian brothers- uh, are sympathetic and can see that, um,  that's part of the healing process.
Not necessarily to  give us  trillions of dollars  but to acknowledge that a great wrong has been done, and something needs to be done to correct that because as long as you keep ignoring, um,  the situation,  and it continues to, um,  fester, and um, it- it- it doesn't do the two  injured parties-  the oppressed is just as much, uh, injured as  the suppressor.
Yep.
And uh,  so that's what we're trying to do.
I'm a member of NCOBRA.
And uh, been supportive.
As a matter of fact, I would bring the, um-  the national board here  and uh,  a retreat.
And we would go on the- on the  banks of Tar River, and I would show them, uh-  talk, you know, a little bit of the history about  the area and  how- where I was baptized.
But they would come down and um,  spend  about maybe  two or three days here.
Yeah.
This was um-  I got that-  I got some publications on that somewhere.
So it musta been  two thousand and  t- two.
Yeah, the summer two thousand and two.
Yep.
Well I had invited 'em to come down because of the uh- the historical significance of it being the oldest,  uh,  settlement  uh, by African Americans.
And I thought it would be a good place for them to come and-  and see,  um,  what-  what progress  hasn't been made and what progress has been made.
And uh,  and- but they came down and kept low keyed and they had their meetings and stuff and- and would get a new strategies.
Well we would t- we were having a hard time, um,  tryna get  the Congress, the  presidential candidates,  and anybody else that  wanted to use our votes  to um-  to recognize  uh, what we wanted.
And um,  Texas-  we- we- we've got um,  I think it's about  maybe ten-  ten states that are interested in  helping us ecstablish a commission  to study  the post-  or as it's called  post slavery trauma.
And um,  you know.
So,  w- w- we'll get there  and this H two- H forty bill is a bill that would be introduced by, uh,  Congressman John Conyers, out of uh, Michigan.
Yep.
And uh, this week-  today is the eighteenth?
This week they're having a conference, uh, in Washington DC  for three or four days  um,  to discuss  things and  you know recall  strategies of the best way to- to present it without  um,  l- f- u- looking- looking like a threat.
We just want people to  acknowledge the wrong and  let's see if we can, um,  do something correcting it because, uh, I have, um,  talked to kids about it.
Uh,  for instance their uh-  their behavior,  their psychological inheritance of, uh,  not being all they can be is um-  is a result of being,  uh, how do we say, uh,  uh, descendants of  Jim Crowism and racism.
Yep.
And uh,  the only way you can  purge this-  this, um-  this  uh- defect  is to start with the children,  and you have to educate that seed  because as quiet as it's being kept,  if you have that- let's say that old oak tree out there, as old that it- as it is-  This is an analogy.
If you don't uh, nurture it,  uh,  take care of it,  it will still produce  um,  a small defected  acron.
So what you have to do, you have to take that acron  as a seed- seedling  and nourish that  and get rid of all the uh- it's called biogenics- uh-  that would effect us and w- and human beings are the same way.
For instance, um, as great as my little home town is here,  we were still uh, effected  because  the healing process has not been taken seriously and so that's we're asting  m- mainly, you know,  through reparation,  is to um,  do something for the children  uh, for the next generation.
Start some programs,  uh, set some programs in place,  where  all the kids will be-  It'll be mandatory or guaranteed  to get an education because if you don't educate that seed, if you don't nurture that seed on the tree, it's gonna produce the same  um,  and so this is what you see- I call that apathy.
Um, here- - is one of the chief reasons why Princeville  can't um,  move forward.
The stagnation is still-  is still here.
And some folks  know about it and some folks don't,  but um,  I have to be  sort of  precarious about  how I say it.
Because once again, you know,  I'm an- I'm- I'm aware that I'm of a minority.
And uh,  and you just have to be careful how you say what you say.
But hoping that you can appeal  to the, um,  to the goodness-  the goodness of man,  of those that listen to it and say yes, it is time.
It's long overdue, that something should be done.
And once again, not necessarily, um,  monetary.
But programs that could help, um,  help- help set- set- set things sort of  in a- in a balance.
Yep.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
They're- They're not popular.
Even though people know,  um,  those that um-  how do we say um,  that are concerned-  they know that there's uh, an existing problem but  they-  they won't  speak up  or won't stand up and say anything about it.
E- and even though  I have some very good white friends too,  now  they won't say anything about it because  I don't think they really want to revisit  the ugly past.
But at the same time, they need to be gently  awakened to say well, the only way  we can get past that  is to  address it and go from there.
W-  w- you know, you know, so.
Mm-hm.
Well,  this place, from what I've been told, um,  f- w- was first called Freedom Hill  and um,  I can imagine my great great grandparents were part of those um,  first freed um,  slaves that would settle here.
Yeah it was RD-NAME-2, and it was probably his um- his dad,  or maybe him too.
But uh,  all around  uh, Edgecombe County, Nash County,  it was a  chief cotton and tobacco,  corn and peanuts  and uh, that was their crop and so they were getting the free slave labor but they uh, were emancipated,  they needed a place  to um,  we call herd-  to- to put 'em.
And the Union soldiers were camped over here, uh,  and so  all of a sudden I guess someone  assigned, said well,  that's a safe haven for them because  Jim Crowism was still  going on-  that the- some of the southerners  just was bitter about  taking their free-  free slave labor away from 'em.
And uh, but they would come over here and this would become  um,  an important route in the Underground Railroad.
Freedom Hill.
the- the- the slaves uh, running from  the south  as far as uh, Georgia and South Carolina,  hoping they would find refuge and safety by going North.
Well Freedom Hill was, um-  was a spot that they would achieve to come.
And so at one time, I think they had about fifteen  hundred to two thousand people here at one time.
Yeah.
Of free slaves.
And um, you had educators,  uh, that would come in, uh, Doctor RD-NAME-2,  who was a Jamaican,  he would be the first one to set up a  school here.
I think it's was a  four room  school.
Yep, and  I- I don't know exactly where that was,  but I-  it's been told that um,  RD-NAME-2 or either  RD-NAME-3 and them,  uh, would donate  that land  where the original school-  the school that I went to back in nineteen forty six.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yep.
Yep.
And mama- think my mom would go there,  my dad would go  to that school,  and they were born in fifteen and sixteen- nineteen fifteen, nineteen f- nineteen sixteen.
And um,  so it's been around.
Yep.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Whatchu talk- Which- What you talking about?
Well g- granddaddy, uh, RD-NAME-1  um,  they would come in here from Rocky Mount,  the RD-NAME-2.
But uh he would work for the railroad.
I don't know ex- I don't know what great granddaddy- what- what he did for a living,  whether he was a carpenter or farmer.
Coulda been a farmer.
Yeah but uh,  granddaddy uh, RD-NAME-1, RD-NAME-1's husband, which is my granddaddy and grandmama.
Uh, I never did see him, but I saw my ma- uh- granddaddy would die for my father would be twelve years old, but uh,  I hear daddy talk about it, say that um-  that same uh, railroad track that runs  east and west um,  used to stop  the- uh-  and would let him off there  coming from the roundhouse in uh- in Rocky Mount.
And uh, he used to  go meet him.
He could tell when he was coming or you hear the whistle and he would  go out there and wait  and- and walk and meet him.
Yeah, I can- I can see him doing that.
Yep.
As a- as a kid  going to meet his dad.
And he would walk us along that same track, my dad.
Yeah.
Yeah my daddy, well he would try to work for railroad but he said that work was just too hard for him,  and I think he said he lasted about a week.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, the Atlantic Coast L- Atlantic Coast Line.
To home- Uh-huh, yep.
Yep.
They would drop- they would drop him off if he didn't drive or  he would catch the train on his way to Mildred or going out to Bethel or Williamston or whatever.
And they would uh- would stop  in uh,  freight- freight train  and let him off of.
And um- Uh- yeah, let me see.
Daddy was younger than twelve when- when grandpa was doing this.
Yep.
On the tracks, yeah l- yep.
Yep.
He knew what time to, um, to go wait for him  and um,  so he looked forward to that.
It was exciting.
He-  I- I'm- I'm still um,  amazed  of trains too.
I would end up working for um,  RD-WORK-3.
Yeah.
Which was uh,  Chesapeake and Ohio but now they call it the CSX  uh- tr- yep.
Mm-hm.
M-  Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Uh,  th- there was a different family.
Um,   RD-NAME-5 I think was his name.
They would stay there when I was a kid, but I- but I knew that there- that was the history of the man that had founded Princeville.
That was- The legacy was-  t- it was attached to that, yeah.
Of the history?
Well in our house, he had uh,  couple of matriarchs there.
Aunt RD-NAME-2, who was the oldest  of 'em-  of my aunts, and she um-  she loved to sit around.
She and- and my RD-NAME-1, her mother, and we'd sit on the porch and just listen  to the story.
I got some pictures, me and uh-  they out in the-  in the car- of me s-  in a diaper.
I guess I'm about  five years old,  see my grandm-  RD-NAME-1,  to me, was white.
Yeah.
Blue eyes, silver blue hair.
And uh, and we are standing- RD-NAME-2 is standing next to her.
He's sitting and I'm standing, and I think I got a lollipop  in my mouth.
And she's got her arm around me.
But um,  she- she used to-  used to tell us  some stories  in uh- on the front porch.
We had a grape vine  on- on both ends of the porch.
One- one end of the porch was screened in.
We had two swings.
And she would um,  sit us in the swing with her  and she would  just  rock  the swing with us gently and- and tell- and tell how- about- you know, when she was growing up.
Now her mom would come out of um,  a little place called Lawrence's.
RD-NAME-2.
RD-NAME-1-  RD-NAME-1 uh, RD-NAME-2.
Yep.
And that's what she was, a RD-NAME-2 before she married um,  grandpa.
Yeah.
Can you imagine, man, what it was like for her?
You know, now  granddaddy was as dark as that book case.
But he was smart.
He was a business man.
Cause he was buying real estate uh, with his money that he was making from the railroad.
And for him to um,  have married  t- um, RD-NAME-1  and to move in Princeville,  can imagine-    Yeah.
Yep.
Yeah next time you- when you come back  um,  uh, with your camera, I'll have all s- s-  these pictures for you to see.
Yeah.
Yeah.
B- Mm-hm.
Right.
Uh-huh.
February- February thirteenth, nineteen forty.
Yep.
And um,  a legendary  doctor-  Doctor RD-NAME-6.
would assist.
And uh,  my mama told me, she say, and they would name me for-  for- for doctor-  doc- doctor RD-NAME-2.
RD-NAME-2- RD-NAME-2, yeah.
Yeah.
And um- On him?
Yep.
Yep.
And um,  like I say,  I was born the year of the flood,  and they had a flood in nineteen forty.
That I don't remember  being so young but I remember another one in forty-  forty six or forty f-  I think I had just started school.
Then they said the next one here is in fifty eight.
But that was a smaller one, which would cause us to move out here.
Yeah in the forties.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah it came- it came up to the house-  to the-  to the porch  and maybe  where the back  y- back  uh, kitchen parts  sort of declined.
I think it came up in there a little bit.
Yep.
I remember um,  us pushing you know, with the brooms and shovels getting the- the s- the- the silt  and the mud out of it.
Yep.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
Yeah, and uh,  getting on uh- getting on the boat.
But prior to that flood,  I remember my uncle RD-NAME-1,  which was the baby boy, um,  going off  or was he coming in from, um,  World War Two.
He was sick.
Yeah, I think he had malaria.
He had caught that in Iwo Jima or either the Philippine Islands.
I remember them bringing him home.
So I musta been around about- I hadn't started school then.
But I remember that.
And uh,  oh and RD-NAME-2 I had some-  some-  some vivid  incidents  um,  back in the day that I-  I remember my first dog, Snowball.
Pure white Eskimo Spitz, and I used to lay down on the ground with him,  and then in the backyard, we had this big yard,  no grass,  and the ground was as hard as concrete.
And we used to sweep it  with the  brush brooms.
And it would look neat  a-  uh, once you cl- you know, got it  cleaned and neat.
And um,  I used to lay on that  ground and look at that dog, look him in his eyes and  he'd look me right in mine and  then I would draw him.
I would draw on this ground.
That's how I would- I learned to-  to draw- you know, my- my skills of art.
And um,    the- and I'm shooting marbles right in that same ground.
Now grass grew  on the side  of the yard,  but not-  that was our play area.
And  I used to be so mischievous man.
I recall  um,  after so many close incidents, with death, my mama and them, they got a chain,  a dog chain, and put it around my waist.
Yeah.
And uh,  today that would be looked upon  as abuse.
But to me,  that wont nothing but love.
Cause I was-  I was into it.
I was  not  a bad kid, just inquisitive.
Uh,  she- mama, she used to say,  at three and four years old, you used to cross that railroad track, used to walk out the back, down by that pecan tree, through the garden, to go see her mom, which lived across the railroad track.
And she said she used to see this red head  going  and um,  she would hear mama-  RD-NAME-4 her mama-  would holler back,  I got him.
And I would sh- .
I was always telling 'em,  I wanted to go see Ma RD-NAME-3.
I wanna go see Ma RD-NAME-3.
But she w-  man, but um,    i- it was too much for mama.
She said she couldn't take it  cause  one of us- I think my baby- younger brother had got hitten by a car,  going across the street  to Mr.
RD-NAME-1 house where RD-NAME-3 RD-NAME-2 stay.
And um,  so that's when uh, the chain  came in  in the play- and uh-  it- it-  it was long enough for me to- and she put it around that big pecan tree.
And I'd be just as-  I'm'a tell you.
I know what the deal was.
This ain't no abuse.
This is life saving.
Yeah cause- Yeah RD-NAME-1.
Yeah, he- there- it was four of us.
And the third boy  uh, RD-NAME-1 he would be hit by uh,  a car.
And um- No, n- didn't hurt him, just a little bump on the head.
By that time, it wa- they was using a- them A model or T model Fords.
And they kind of high, and so uh- and they weren't g- the man wasn't going that fast.
And um- Yeah get every- get everybody upset.
Yep.
And we had a- a gentleman here in town by the name of Mr.
RD-NAME-2 who wore three or four hats.
He was  the police chief,  he was electrician,  he was everybody's daddy, he- and he and my daddy were pretty tight too.
And he had horses.
So he would-  RD-NAME-2 was just- he was our hero.
But I remember one day  I-  his daughter RD-NAME-3, and RD-NAME-4 who happened to stay in Mr.
RD-NAME-2's house, we were standing on the sidewalk-  Would you believe we had sidewalk?
Back in the forties?
And um,  looking at him  and my daddy work this-  pull these lines up,  running these- these electric wires.
And along came this-  was it a bus or a truck?
Anyway,  daddy had to cut  the wire because it didn't seem like that guy was gonna stop.
And when he cut it just in time,  it wrapped around that car-  the car's wheel,  and we were standing on it-  on the line, on the sidewalk.
And it would pick us up  and  throw us.
RD-NAME-3 went under the car.
I don't know what happened to RD-NAME-4, but I would be- I would land  on the front porch of my Uncle RD-NAME-1's house  in the swing.
And I remember this like it was yesterday.
I was um,  druggy man and it just hurting,  and he didn't know  what to do cause they- but he just picked me up, and when he did, I- one of my bones,  rib bones was cracked.
And uh,  he came around the back  and  put-  told us about a pump- just to pump water.
A little hand pumps.
And I remember that coming down on face, and I- j- I thought he was tryna drown me.
But anyway, Daddy come running around and, where's RD-NAME-2?
And they- and just- s- Uncle RD-NAME-1 say,  we got to get him to the hospital, say he's bleeding.
And um,  at that time,  Doctor RD-NAME-2 didn't have an emergency room, and  Edgecombe General  was downtown.
And at that time, black folks  weren't um,  allowed to come through an emergency situation.
You had-  they had to look at you first and get your name and your birthday.
You could be bleeding out your head.
And uh,  but daddy you know, broke on in there, and uh, had a few harsh words.
He tell 'em, say, we need a doctor around here- We ain't got time to go through none of that- that  ism.
And uh, that would be my first encounter uh, in the emergency room.
Yeah.
Yep.
O- over- you know- and in a hospital- within a hospital  as many close shaves I would get myself into.
But over all, man, my uh- my life's  growing up here in Princeville  was just  like a paradise.
Yep, we were poor, didn't know it,  didn't care about it, wont worried about it.
Yeah.
Christmas time come,  I thought I had something if I had  a orange  and uh,  some  grapes or raisins and an apple and one toy.
I was tickled to death.
Yep.
And uh,  but the Christmas tree,  I will never forget RD-NAME-2 the baby girl  uncle- aunt, she- it was her job to um-  to make the snow The fake snow?
And we- we get us the tree out of the woods, a cedar tree.
And uh,  she used to get us on the floor,  uh, all the kids, me and my brothers,  and cut these rings out of n- of paper, a- about a half an inch  wide and maybe  three inches long, and we would use um,  this old white s- stick,  glue, to make these chains and loop 'em.
But before we did that, we would  use crayon and color 'em different colors.
These would be the Christmas loops, the Christmas chains around the .
And then I remember one- one Christmas, she got fancy with us.
She had us sewing  popcorn, put popcorn on a- you know, and and uh, the angel hair  and those big  light- Christmas light bulb about the size of an egg.
Those were the ones, man.
You remember?
You don't know nothing about that.
The big ones.
Yeah, them big ones -  Yeah.
They were on a-  on a big big  wire, but you talking about something pretty.
Man that would just- just-  just- just did something to me.
And I would- I be looking for 'em now.
Say I wish I could find some of them big bulbs.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Well we had uh-  it- it was a nice neighborhood, ha- had houses um, close together, nice front yards  with hedges  and crepe myrtle.
We had a crepe myrtle tree- we had two crepe myrtle trees in the front yard.
I used to  climb up.
And used to carve um, my name on 'em  and then we had a mulberry, a  big mulberry tree that sat on the line, which was right-  it divided the- the property line of uh,  RD-NAME-6.
The RD-NAME-2's and our house.
And um,  I remember eating those-  those dark  purple  juicy uh- berries man.
And then in the back we had  two cherry trees that was on the line and we used to go back there and uh,  go up the cherry tree and just  stay up in the cherry tree and eat til we get sick.
Just eat them big black cherries or-  Yep.
And the plums  uh, yeah, that grew wild on- on the-  you know, in the woods, the yellow sugar plum and then you had the red one.
And then the blackberries.
But um,  what I- what I really remember  most of all was going to school.
My first days going to school in Princeville.
Yep.
All of my buddies um,  we would go there together.
My first grade teacher was named Miss RD-NAME-2.
And come to find out, she would teach my mom.
Yeah.
And um,  then Miss RD-NAME-3 which was Mr.
RD-NAME-2's wife, she taught second grade.
And Miss RD-NAME-2, third grade.
Miss RD-NAME-2 had a reputation  of uh,  being the baddest teacher.
She would beat you  um-  The other teachers- if the other teachers uh- couldn't- uh, didn't want to beat you,  they send you to Miss RD-NAME-2.
Miss RD-NAME-2 act like she would be waiting- waiting for the opportunity to get on somebody's case.
And then the fourth grade teachers was Mrs.
RD-NAME-2.
And that's as-  that's as high as Princeville would go.
And then from there we would go over to um,  RD-SCHOOL-3 Elementary which was Miss RD-NAME-2 would be the fifth grade teacher.
Yeah.
RD-SCHOOL-7.
Uh-huh.
Segregated s- Mm-hm.
Y- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
That was great man.
Yep.
The years uh, was it forty nine and fifty?
And um,  I would meet    our music teacher, Mrs RD-NAME-2.
She would  detect the tenor-  the vocal tr- you know, talent that I had.
Plus I had already been singing in my first church over here that I would join which was Macedonia Baptist.
Which set in a cow pasture.
Uh,  right there where RD-NAME-1's- I think when you came- soon as you crossed the railroad track, well,  just to the right,  where you see RD-NAME-1's um,    what is it- hazardous material?
That's where Macedonia Baptist Church used to be.
And it was this um,  bull out there that we used to  have fun with during my mischievous times, you know.
But um,  that uh-  Miss RD-NAME-2 uh,  she would- she would- she would see that  that little boy can sing a little bit.
And uh r-  just bring me along and I'd get in the choir  at RD-SCHOOL-3 and  I think they got some pictures-  somebody's got some pictures of me in the choir, but um,  and we would- they would travel.
My older brother RD-NAME-2 was also in the choir.
He sang too.
Yep.
So we got our singing  from mom,  and then I would  find out I was athletic- um, -ly  inclined too, physically.
