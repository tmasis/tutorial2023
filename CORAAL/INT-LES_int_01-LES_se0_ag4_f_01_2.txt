I just think there's some that are  harder to fight than others.
No, I think this one is particularly sneaky.
I don't that much about it.
I know someone else that passed away from it, and they- I just  I think a ye- at least a year.
I don't remember.

I wanna know if  everybody that lives in  these  boundaries that we just talked about, are they all part of the Lower East Side community?
And what does it take to be a community member?
Yeah.
So, the new, uh, the yuppies that are moving in they're not for you.
And what would it take for them to could they ever become part of the community?
So, participation.

I think it's on like Fourth Street.
Yeah, they were good.
I took, we took our cats.
No.
They were fine.
We took our cats to another place on Christie.
Just south of Houston.
And I didn't like that vet.
He wasn't-  he wasn't very nice.
I think it was, they were similar.
It was like, you know like a sixty dollars for a visit or something like that.
Ah, we've never done that with our cats.
Our cats haven't had- knew that we- ta- have taken them for like a check up or  like a cold, where it would  give 'em a-  you know.
Two.
But, they're young.
So, they haven't gotten really sick.
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
I know.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
RD-NAME-4 I recognize that name.

No, but now they're t- they're thinking of reze- working on Chinatown rezoning, right?
That was.
I know.
Right.
Wow.
Yeah.
Now, RD-NAME-2 from goals, I think is  the one who gave me your contact info.
She said that you were also knowledgeable about  one of the issues that I've been involved with, which is the Seward Park Urban Renewal Site.
Yeah.
Is that how you see it?
Yeah.
And do you think he's representing some constituents in the neighborhood that.
This was in.
two thousand three?
I read about it.
Yeah.
You were there?
Because it was so crowded?
What do you remember about that meeting?
Yeah.
And what do you think about, uh, the situation now with that site?
Has anything changed?
I mean the- has the fact that the  composition of the neighborhood in terms of the people I mean.
Co-ops are now  market rate, so there's new people moving in there,  Do you think that could change?
The Klan?
Yeah.
Oh.
And so, if it were up to you.
Yeah.
The moderate kind of.
Right.
Yeah.
Too much, but not enough.
So, if it were up to you, what would you build on that site?
What would i- what would you like to see?
That moderate.
Mm-hm.
What do you think of mixed models of like low, moderate, and middle  all together?
Mm-hm.
Where?
Ah.
Oh.
So,  It could be done.
But, it's hard.
Yeah.
What about any commercial things?
Would you- would you wanna see a commercial space?
On that site?
What kind?
Home Depot, Mom and Pop, you know, something in between?
Mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
Right.
That's right.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
You'd like that?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh, too bad.
Oh, that's great.
Well, you have the Essex Street Market not too far away.
Right?
That's good.
Yeah, you can get produce right?
It's not.
Yeah.
Right.
They truck it in that morning or whatever.
Yeah.
So, with this SPURA Site, I mean what do you think's gonna happen there?
Do you  do you feel.
Yeah.
Do you feel that there's any hope?
For like hope for  Yeah.
Yeah.
He really does.
Yeah.
That's true.
No, I'm fine, thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
What do you- What's your opinion about  about building height  in developments in the community?
Like- or on that site in particular.
Do you have  parti- Okay.
Okay.
So you'd think that something's too tall.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
So w- is that a tradeoff that you are willing to take part in?
Like the- you can go a little higher if you get some more affordable units?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
No.
No.
Not gonna happen.
You'd think we would.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you- so you think there's a possibility that-  that the  tide could change a little bit.
That things could move down there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm, Right.
Yeah.
Do you think it's important for people to know about the history of that site?
And the history of the neighborhood kind of in general?
Like the new folks that are moving in.
It has.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
We're low.
Yeah.
Um.
Okay.
I have-  I think I have two more questions for you.
The first is, uh  if you  plan to stay in the neighborhood?
Do you wanna stay here you know?
I-  Do you wanna continue living here?
Yeah.
And you'll stay here til then.
And then wha- and then what?
Yeah.
So, you'll be- you'd like to stay  in the lo-  long term, but you're gonna.
Sounds like you'll be forced to go somewhere else.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Do you still wanna live here given the- the things that you've talked about in terms of the changes, the  changing character of the neighborhood?
Is it still a place where you-  That you consider home?
And that you like?
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Okay.
Um.
Okay.
So my last question then is um,    If you could  think ahead ten years or twenty years.
I- I'm interested in where you think the neighborhood's going.
What do you think it's gonna be like in ten years?
Mm-hm.
And you th- do you think that's gonna happen?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So  So you s- so you see the- the gentrification continuing?
Yeah.
I know.
It's true.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Right.
Do they?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Well, it will be interesting to see what happens here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If more people did that.
It'd be a good thing.
Yeah.
I I think Yeah.
If we ever bought, we'd have to move to Brooklyn I think because we couldn't afford it.
Couldn't afford it around here.
Yeah.
Fifth Street.
Yeah.
Ten-  tenement.
Oh A and B.
No.
I don't know.
people in my building, no.
I don't think so.
Really?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Mm-hm.
That's not my buildi- I live in, um, a little farther towards A.
Over on in just a little tenement building.
I- we love it actually, we've been there for five years and it's great but.
But it helps being married  to share a room and everything like that.
But, it's crazy.
You know, it's crazy.
But, we moved here from Brooklyn  because  Brooklyn be- was becoming just as expensive.
We found a good deal.
Williamsburg.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
No.
Oh.
Cool.
Oh, really?
That's great.
Yeah.
Oh.
That's funny.
That's terrific.
Uh, there's a lot of young- a lot of young people over there in Williamsburg.7 Oh the older people?
Yeah.
Ah.

Oh.
Oh, that's terrible.
