Animal porno is on some  next level shit.
It's gonna happen.
You gonna see it because you're not gonna get warned  when it comes on  at all.
Now,  I got a story for you to read.
I'm sorry  I'm making you do this.
You gonna hafta  try to make it out as best as you can.
I need you to read that passage out loud.
The entire passage.
It's really two of 'em.
This-  the first one is the long one pause but, um, Yeah, bruh.
It's- it's all good, bruh.
My G.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
It's a lot of rats in Baltimore too?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Ooh, okay, okay.
I'm letting you know off the rip, they  probably not even listening  to- yeah, nothing like that.
They don't- really don't care like at all like the content like really just how you speaking.
I probably shouldn't even told you that, but  yeah, unbiasedly just read it how you regularly would, you good.
Ain't no way around it.
Take three,  get it.
Ay, it's cool cause it's- the tape-  the tape is still rolling.
So we gonna  Uh, how about you read the other passage first since that one a little bit shorter.
Nah, not that one, other way at the bottom,  keep going.
That's how long that shit is.
Yeah, read that one.
Okay.
Oh, man.
Okay.
You gotta be serious, bruh.
Read- read it, bruh.
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Um, we can probably save that one for the end.
I usually save both of 'em for the end, but I thought I'd get one out the way.

He said-  Nah, you gucci.
Let's see,  um,  did you still have that hookup earphone as far as that-  that title joint?
Yeah.
Um, what- I mean what-  what would you cur-  curate as of now?
If you just like, um, play some type of music you  Yeah.
I wan-  I wanna know what you listen to that you think that I would like to listen to.

That's what they want you to do, and that's what you gotta do.
Ooh.
You can turn it down a little cause I don't even think we supposed to have music on in this, but- it's cool.
So what about Common though?
We was just mentioning Common in the acting shit.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
Yeah, this is unedited, no edits  all the way through.
If you play a l-  piece of it, play all of it.
Don't play it out of context.
Mm.
Yeah, the- My thought personally in that-  I'll be straight, if you had your own platform big enough that like, ay okay,  I see what y'all saying.
Make sure y'all  hear me when I say this.
This is how I feel about the situation.
Some people got that Yeah.
He did.
Yeah.
He did.
But that was still on camera and that's a on camera threat, like  if anybody is smart, they'll say nah, we ain't doing it.
I mean, yeah, lawsuit, all that different type of stuff.
I met- you at my job, I can get fired.
I can lose money.
Now if I was-  in Akademik's situation  personally, I woulda reacted in a way like  he did on camera,  but then  y'all prob- y'all woulda heard in the blog somewhere like, oh shit, after the set, god damn, that nigga Slay  and Vic Mensa really went at it.
He really had to stomp that nigga, cause Slay, fucked around.
But  I don't know, man.
It's a different world out here.
It's just a different time, and you gotta navigate accordingly.
They want that shit.
Mm-mm.
But that sound like something unintelligible.

That joint is riding so much right now, and I really think they can really hear you.
Tyler, you let me know in the next interview, but  this is sounding really good, though.
Good place, I think this ended out  on a pretty high note, man.
If there's anything else  you wanna just say just to say,  you more than welcome.
