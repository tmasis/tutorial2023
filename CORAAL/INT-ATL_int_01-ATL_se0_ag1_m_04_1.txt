Okay.
Mm-hm.
Wow.
It did go from RD-NAME-3 to RD-NAME-2 and then to RD-NAME-3.
Oh man.
But I- I felt like that- um,  that RD-NAME-2 was definitely always there  even if it was just like a little, um,  also known as little-  little side moniker, but  it's nice to see that you came into the whole RD-NAME-1  thing.
It don't.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
That's- that's huge.
That's major keys.
I try to  speak with them type of themes amongst my friends all the time and stuff,  you know.
Some of 'em get it  quicker than others.
Let's see.
I got a phone call coming in.
That's kind of rude.
And it's my guy RD-NAME-2.
Ah, I didn't even try to decline that.
But, um,  I'll hit him back in a little bit.
Um,  have I ever introduced you to RD-NAME-2?

RD-NAME-1  Oh shit, probably,  possibly.
Big dude?
Yeah, producer dude, yeah.
Mm-hm.

I can't remember, bruh, but  nigga, I thought you was talking about, um,  the classic one  when you said RD-NAME-1.
We gon- we gonna double back on a lot of stuff apparently, man.
Whatch-  Ay.
We only eight minutes in, but we moving smooth.
Who shorty over  there?
Did you, um, have her take your order yet?
I don't know that's a touchdown wing shirt or nah.

I would  be hiring chicks like that too.
But, um,  I digress.
D- I was on YouTube today, man.
I seen some notification pop up on my YouTube timeline.
Genius Deconstructed new beat breakdown.
I'm like, oh okay, yeah, you know, I'm always for-  check out some shit like that,  but that bitch said Cheeze Beatz and Thirty Roc beats  break down the Cartier Bartier  or Bartier Cartier.
I was like, oh shit.
These niggas like  grinding so hard,  or that duet  grinding so hard in particular like  I can't even ignore it even if I wanted to ignore that grind, like that shit is just so  in front of my face.
Now we both mutually know,  you know, the producer  in questioning and stuff like that.
How do you feel about seeing  some of his success I guess in real time right now  in regards to Thirty Roc?
Mm.
Mm.
Sheesh.
Yup.
I ain't even think of it in that type of capacity.
That's huge.
I get what you saying though.
Mm-hm.
That shit going up like Bitcoin.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, you still cut his hair every week?
Oh wow.
That's-  that's .
That's real right there.
Man,  what-  how d- what i- what i-  what-  I don't know, where did the wisdom come from, to where  you can be like, you know what,  I'm'a help this guy at times.
This guy may help me at times regardless, but I'm just gonna have faith  to, you know, rock with certain people or do certain things,  you know, even if-  whether they might pay me back in the future or not.
I always assume that some people would do some of these nice stuff  to get something nice in return if  Mm-hm.
Yup, definitely.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Wow.
How many people you feel actually believe you when you say that?
Okay.
Slick.
Ay nigga, I'm letting you know, I'm packing these bitches.
Don't switch up.
Have you, um,  encountered any, um,  I guess people within the-  the music business that you felt like you had that type of  relationship with,  and then, um, I guess  you, um,  came to the realization that that might not  actually be the case  stuff  from  I'm'a try to- I'm'a try to make it as clear as possible.
Like is there anyone in the music industry business-wise  you've worked with  that, um,  you felt like  you've compensated them or you're-  you know,  you're willing to compensate them now  to, um, be compensated later on in the future, and  I guess  maybe the opportunity came around and that  didn't, um,  come across as such or whatever?
I don't know.
Have you helped somebody out, they get in a situation they can help you out, and they don't help you out?
Okay.
And- um, but what- what- what- what keeps your faith in- what?
Just the fact that you like helping people out, that's the only thing.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Whole lot of wisdom coming from that.
I'm digging all of that,  especially that answer.
Um,  let's see.
What about-  let's, um, double back to school.
I remember, um, mentioning something about high school reunions and stuff.
What- what's your thoughts on that?
Nah, hold up now.
Hold up now cause I- I done been to a couple your shows.
I haven't been to all of 'em I graduated o eight.
Okay, you talking about your o seven fam.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Especially you- you super accessible.
Mm-hm.
They tripping.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Nah, nah, definitely.
That's more so what I'm-  I'm focused on and caught up and stuff.
But I- I do find that interesting cause  we're kind of definitely around that age where they would try some,  you know, half asses, or just something cool or whatever.
But  takes a lot of planning and a lot of people to be on board to try to pull that off, and,  you know, who really cares about trying to  go to them type of things now and stuff.
I don't know, just  That'll probably be so lit too.
Get three of 'em together and for real for real.
You probably l- have something cooking.
ain't gonna lie.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
How old are you?
You twenty-nine.
And you, um,  consider yourself  what nationality?
Okay.
Okay, I respect that,    which is why I didn't, you know,  f- force a- a r- a race or a label on you.
I- I give you that,  you know, your own  inclination whatever that be,  so  you're a god.
Okay.
And, um,  how did you come to that understanding?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Sheesh.
Mm-hm.
Real godly like.
That makes- ay,  I know one thing.
You start talking stuff like this on some, um,  published, um, interviews,  you might really intrigue somebody to go back and listen to some of your music.
Mm.
So shit, do you want people to like your music for you or do you want  people to like  your music because you made it?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
You good, you can take that.
