And that's just the way it was until the last time cause it got up  washed us out good fashion that time.
Uh-huh.
Cause I didn't- I was over time, but I knew somebody if you went through on that stop light down there  on a-  That stop light down there?

Everything around here was under the water.
Yeah.

So you- so when  the fire department got the first call,  and- What?
how- what'd the fire department do during that whole time?
Well we had to run to-    a little this and that, helping the peoples get out of the houses and all that stuff like that,  along with the rescue squad and stuff.
And, you know, you just keep going til  the water got so high, and then the plane was-  helped get people out tents too sometime.
What kind of calls?
Do you remember any calls that you got?
Mm, not really.
Cause I know I- my-  When I left home that evening,  my son in law, Mm-hm.
he was over there, stayed in a trailer over there by the house, and he told us he wont going no where that water wont gonna do nothing.
Mm-hm.
But at the next morning, he's up there on top of that house, hollering for somebody come get him.
He's up on top of the house.
Oh, wow.
And the b- come- they come off from the bypass on a boat and they picked him up Hm.
and carried him back out there towards the bypass out the other way.

That day, right before-  Cause at some point- Let's-  Well see one thing about the day- the fl- when it come- come into that  late that evening, that night, Mm-hm.
it just wont nobody prepared for it to do nothing like that.
So we just started running around here to  do best we could in lights and try to u-  put down something keep it from coming in, stuff like that.
But the water come- it come get- when that kind of water come in, ain't nothing gonna stop it Mm-hm.
It's going over them roads and by dykes and all that stuff.
Mm-hm.
And but one thing it might held it back a little while, but it be coming so fast if-  if it wont for them coming you be in trouble anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So when did you realize it was- it was gonna be that- that high?
Well, the-  the l-  I think   a couple of days  for us find out it was gonna be that high cause that's- it took about that long to get up there in the marsh.
It took about two days to get way up there on like that, didn't it?
