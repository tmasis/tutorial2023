I will stop writing now .
So,  let's go back.
Let's go  back a little bit.
When you talk about Southeast, tell me about your neighborhood growing up.
Mm-hm.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
How big was the neighborhood?
Like how many blocks, streets?
Okay.
Right.
Ten blocks is- that's a big- I was actually thinking maybe you were gonna say like two or three .
That's a big  like area.
Well.
Hm.
Gotcha.
Mm-hm.
So how did like blue collar versus  like, white collar- How do upper middle class and  probably working to middle- lower middle class- How did- could they afford  to live in that neighborhood together?
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Mm.
So how did this-  Two things, and then I'm'a move on from- But how do you f-  How do you- And I don't think- I don't know if you know,  but how did this neighborhood emerge  in the middle of Southeast?
So Southeast historically was a very  rundown or  I will say lower class,  and then you have this upper class neighborhood,  do you kind of know how that  oasis- Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Describe your house.
Like at your childhood home.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Now?
Or before.
Oh.
Mm.
Are houses in Hillcrest kind of going that same  like market?
Or looking at the market, is it  reaching Southeast in that same way?
Mm.
Mm.
Are you an only child?
Okay, so how was it growing up?
Are you the youngest, oldest, middle?
Oh, you're the middle.
So how was it growing up  with-  What's the age difference?
Oh, step-  like step- And how was that?
Did y'all play together?
What types of games did y'all play?
Inaudible.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Did y'all have TV?
Black and white or color?
Mm.
Hm.
Mm,  we had- You were the remote?
Mm-hm.
What elementary schools  did you go to?
Was that different?
Was it a  big- RD-SCHOOL-3.
Right.
So  when you went to-  Compare your experience from what you can remember from RD-SCHOOL-3 to  RD-SCHOOL-3.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Clinton?
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And how long did you stay at RD-SCHOOL-3?
Overt?

Hm.

Hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.

Mm-hm.
Mm.
Right.
And this was when you were in high school?
Before you went to RD-SCHOOL-2- Oh.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
And then how did you leave RD-SCHOOL-3?
Hm.
Why do you say that?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
So you just- It was very different.
Mm.
They still call them the projects.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I'm heading out.
Okay.
Sorry.
You're gonna have to lock up.
Mm, yes ma'am.
Alright.
Have a good weekend.
You too!
And everybody was in their little pocket.
Was it  by race?
Was it by socioeconomic status?
Both?
Hm.
So how did-  You know, how did the- Did it work?
Do you feel like it was a good education, you had a good experience?
Or  no, not so much?
Mm.
Mm.
Why?
Mm.
Did you get involved in all of that stuff?
Like what?
Mm?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Same thing?
Or worse?
Mm.
Who did they hang out with?
Mm.
So  to a point,  but not- Mm.
Now where'd they live?
D-  Do you know?
Okay.
Gotcha.
When you say uptown, what do you mean?
Huh.
I never  heard anybody explain it that way, but that  helps me.
GW being down- I mean understanding that that's the downtown area.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
They-  Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I don't know the whole history, but I've  always wondered about the churches  um, when I went to school there.
Makes sense.
Making the connection .
And now that's a very different  area.
I wanna ask you a question, but before- Cause I wanna ask how you- about college.
But before that,  do you remember the riots?
The sixties, um- I don't know how- That's what- So I think you were really young, but do you have any like- how it affected you as a- a very young person or how you heard your parents talk about it?
There was sixty three and then sixty eight.
Um- I think the looting was- Was that sixty-eight-ish?
That was sixty eight.
Am I making that up?
Or sixty three?
Maybe it's sixty three.
Now I'm getting all confused.
Sixties.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Okay.
And I have no recollection, like, you know.
So how did you get to RD-SCHOOL-1?
Right.
So how'd you get back to RD-SCHOOL-4?
Mm.
Mm.
And RD-SCHOOL-4-  And you went to RD-SCHOOL-4.
Did you get really- Well,  Georgetown is great.
No- .
The Tombs.
Mm.
I'm just saying goodnight and let you know I'm leaving.
Goodnight, I'll see you Monday.
Mm.
Mm.
That is true.
Hm?
Mm-hm.
That surprises me.
People talk about the academic rigor of RD-SCHOOL-4.
Mm.
Oh.
Right.
Could- What was your major in college?
Psychology.
So how did you end up-  How did you-  Because your dad was an attorney, is that why you wanted to be an attorney?
Mm-hm.
And so attorney you were.
And you've been doing it for-  That's been  pretty much your whole adult careers?
In the legal field?
Have you enjoyed it?
Doesn't work?
Mm-hm.
Would you ever go back and study it?
I'm'a shift the conversation for a minute.
Have you been a tourist in your own town?
You know, people travel miles and miles to come to DC to go to the monuments, go to the White House, all these things, and it's in your backyard.
Mm-mm.
Mm.
She's in Georgia.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
She's here for the summers.
Yeah.
It is.
People come from miles and miles and miles.
There are two things that are very unique to DC.
I'm pretty sure you can guess.
Go go music  and mumbo sauce.
Do you like go go music?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
I think it's the go go.
You go to the go go and then you  hear go go music.
Mm-hm.
Do the Right Thing Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Do you frequent the carry outs?
Now how do you define a carry out?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
That was a very good description.
And we don't have like- What I think of carry out for me-  what I originally thought it was just a Chinese  restaurant.
Like,  that you just go pick up the food.
But we don't have these  all like  pan  nationality of food.
Like you can't go get Asian  American seaf- You- We don't have those types of places.
Like, it's  kind of your one stop  Walmart shop  for food?
We don't have that.
So- Mm-hm.
So-  So I didn't understand that concept.
So when I see I can get a steak and cheese and spare rib tips and shrimp at a c-  It  messed me up a little bit.
Like, what?
And then you-  Mm.
