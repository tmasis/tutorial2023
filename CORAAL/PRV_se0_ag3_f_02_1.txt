Nineteen, uh,  thirty-nine, November the eleventh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I was born in Princeville,  and, um,  most of my family lived here, in this area.
No, my maiden,  uh, family was the RD-NAME-2.
And my grandmother lived right on the other road, you know where the church is?
At the corner?
Her property was there all the way down to, uh, Neville Street.
She even almost gave the property to the church to be built there.
And also Pioneer Court behind where the church is, she, uh, sold that to the town  so they could build that area.
Yeah she's one of the pioneers, uh-huh.
Yeah, one of the apartments was named in her honor back there.
Mm-hm.
Okay my grandmother, uh,  years back I remember she had a store, a small store.
Which was in the parking lot area where the church is now.
And uh, she was very well known with all the people in the community of all races and they just loved her.
She was a very outspoken person  she didn't stand any mess.
Um, years back I remember you know like family reunion time and especially every Sunday, everybody would go over to Granny's house and there we would celebrate and en- enjoy each other.
And this  just wasn't the family and it was everybody in the community you know was involved.
Yes.
Yes, yes.
The people in this area, in  the Princeville area-  Uh, Mrs.
RD-NAME-2 where you see the fish market in there,  folk?
She, my grandmother, uh, my dad also had a garage and store,  which was located in the area where the cement is out there.
And, um,    at that time they had the Bridger's store,  uh, which located over by the town hall.
And, um,  These were the main shopping areas you know, in Princeville.
R- right.
Right.
Right.
And, uh, years ago we had, um,  the beginning of the church where  the first stop light is before going over to the bypass.
That was uh,  where the um,  <ts  founders  area for Princeville, the town hall used to be there, there's an old picture  down in the town uh, where you can see.
And we also have that same picture over at the church.
As you enter into the vestibule.
And, uh, it had a grocery market there.
They also had, uh, something like a little theater  where they used to have benches.
I was small but I still remember.
And people will come and watch the movie, they had a screen.
Along that time um,  there was a person  uh, came here um,    ooh.
It wasn't the shadow,  but this man travel  all around, I think he came from some parts of Detroit and he would interview people.
And say um-  I can't think of this man's name now.
But um, he would tell you know,  different things about the people in the community.
And he s- uh- uh, tell you to guess who it is, you know.
And by people being so close together, they would know exactly who he's talking about.
So that was interesting.
And even from there, he went worldwide.
There was um,   some type of  um,  movie  on television.
And I cannot think of the exact  you know,  um- Yeah the title of that.
But it- it'll probably come to me as I talk.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I can't, I really just can't think of the man's name now.
But he's real popular and he's worldwide.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah, years ago.
So it um-  Also, my neighbor that live across,  she was some of the first people that had a uh, hat  shop.
But this wasn't in Princeville, she lived in Princeville, But it was on Main Street in Tarboro.
And her name is RD-NAME-5.
She's very elderly now.
But uh- My grandparent- RD-NAME-2  uh,  RD-NAME-4  RD-NAME-2.
And we uh, as when we were young we were, uh, laugh at Granny's uh, middle name, you know.
And she came from uh, Pitt County.
Mm  and my grandad  uh, was RD-NAME-4.
Grandaddy came from Beaufort County.
It's not too far, maybe  about a hundred miles, would you say RD-NAME-1?
Beaufort?
Mm-hm.
But um-  And my- and now my mother was born in Pitt County also.
But she was bred here and um- in the Edgecombe County area.
And my dad came from, um,  Halifax County.
And uh, that's a old family too.
Got a lot of relatives.
But you know as dad passed away I lost touch in that side of the family.
But the old ones still know, they come by, you know.
Every once in a while.
RD-NAME-2  RD-NAME-2 And my mother was RD-NAME-4.
W- RD-NAME-4.
Mm-hm.
Oh yeah.
My dad said that  when  he was dating my mother- You know where the bridge is?
He said, uh, my mom would come and call, RD-NAME-2.
And said, if she hear my grandmama call her, so she would jump out of that car and come running.
So he could hear it all the way you know, over there and that's really amazing, isn't it?
Yes, yes.
But um,  there's a lot of things and growing up uh, here in the Princeville area there was different families,  which all have grown up and most of 'em have moved away.
But uh, we went uh, swimming one time down  where the graveyard is, they had a old sand pit down there, with your water, clear water.
And we would slip down there and go bathing.
And the lady that lived across from the graveyard, she called our parents.
Time we got home, everybody got a good spanking, and the whole community you could hear kids crying  You know it's- it's really amazing how things like that happen and young people don't understand you know, how close  families were then.
It's much different now.
You know everybody's individual and  they're not as close.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, most of the kids all went to the same school in this area.
And a matter of fact,  where the town hall, the historical building, that's where I went to school.
First through fourth grade.
It was four rooms there First, second, third, and fourth.
And my teachers, I remember all of them.
And uh- My first grade teacher was Mrs.
RD-NAME-2.
And my second uh, grade teacher was Mrs.
RD-NAME-3.
The third grade was um, Mrs.
RD-NAME-2, RD-NAME-4.
And um,    my  fourth- did I say third?
My fourth grade teacher  was Mrs.
uh,  RD-NAME-2.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Miss RD-NAME-2.
Uh-uh.
Mm-mm.
RD-NAME-2?
From the school?
Yeah.
No no no no.
All of our- my teachers are deceased now.
All of them.
Mm-hm.
Uh-uh.
Yes.
Ooh.
It was very very close.
Um,  during that time um, the school had only  the main entrance where you go in to the different rooms.
And like,  when we had uh, overall seminar uh, we would come into one big room, all the kids had devotion in the morning.
And after that we would split up and go to our different rooms.
And this happened every day.
You know.
And the kids would do Pledge of Allegiance and all of this.
And  the little hall area where the town hall had at one time  is where they would do snacks and stuff like this.
And I'll never forget, Daddy uh,  got at me about  walking the Tom walkers.
And he said, don't you get on the Tom walkers.
You don't do that, you can ride on the-  merry go round.
But don't get on that Tom walker.
And the reason why he said that because,  kids would jump on your back, while you up there and it make you fall down.
It- it's uh, made like a  U.
And it has the bars go where you walk like this.
Uh-huh.
Monkey bars, monkey bars.
Uh-huh, Tom walker at that time.
And then um- He told me not to get on it and at lunch time, the kids that lived close by went home for lunch and they go back.
And that day he remind me,  RD-NAME-2 don't you go on that Tom walker.
So I went back to school and when we had recess it's the first thing I got on.
Cause I was a daredevil.
And I got up there and somebody really jumped on my back.
I just had a fit, and uh, I can remember Miss RD-NAME-2 telling me,  don't cry, your daddy's coming to get you take you to the hospital.
I tell her, no no.
No I didn't want him to come.
He carried me to the hospital I had to get uh, that arm in uh, a cast.
And um,  after he did that,  he asked the doctor,  was it alright he had to-  uh, he had to pay a debt to me.
The doctor didn't know what he was talking about.
But he gave me a good spanking.
Yeah.
I tell you I never forgot it, I never forgot that.
But- I never went back on 'em.
Mm-mm.
Get her- get away.
Roxie.
She must been running.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Oh it was about  I guess about four weeks.
You know before they would  test it out and everything, it didn't last very long.
But uh- Mm-hm.
Yes.
We uh,  At that time where the fire station is now, is where the old church,  the beginning church,  second church, rather  that uh, we had.
And it was sitting right  by where the-  the branch is, cause when the water would come up it would come up right to the side of the church.
In that church, believe it or not,  we had um,  the wooden t- at first,  we didn't have uh, wooden floor in that church.
It was a cement block building.
I'm telling-  And growing up there, I was in the junior choir, and we would come in and have service  every uh-  every Wednesday night we would have prayer service and people would come around for  walk to church.
And we, uh, went to church and one  afternoon about  I guess six or seven in the afternoon,  somebody came down and told my m- my mom  that the house was on fire.
And  everybody just broke out of the church, ran down and what it was, the refrigerator uh, got hung with something.
And it just started smoking up and everything.
So it didn't burn the house but it was smoked up pretty bad.
And  everybody was o-  after everything was okay everybody went back to church.
And went back to service.
Came down to see.
And you know,  this wasn't just  uh, one family but everybody was concerned about everyone else.
You know.
Some of the older people in the community  the majority of 'em has passed away.
You know the real old old people.
And uh,  we had a  pastor  at that time would commute from um,  Goldsboro.
And- and uh, he would come down when we have service first uh, and third Sundays.
And I say, we have really grown because now we have it every Sunday.
And some more.
So uh,  also in-  during that time um,  some of the  older people in the church  where the  new-  the building is being built now by the stop light, right down from the uh- from the uh,  town hall.
There was a man named Mr.
RD-NAME-3.
He had the s- a store there, years and years ago.
Right in that corner where  this uh, young man now is trying to get his business started.
And that was a foundation too, that-  that was there for years.
There was sort of like a uh, grocery store convenience store.
And people would come and stop there.
You know, community people and people also traveling.
He was one of our founders in the church too.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Really,  it w- had everything you wanted in that little store sitting on the corner.
And on the other side where um, the blacksmith place is, There is where my friend, my girlfriend stayed.
And it was a two story building.
And uh,  he did uh,  sort of everything.
Everything in that store.
That was some of the history too of the little ar-  shopping area you know that we had in Princeville at that time.
It was Mr.
RD-NAME-3 store,  and then um,  RD-NAME-3 and her dad live on the other corner, and as I tell you before where the um,  Davis' building, that was a two story building.
And there are pictures, there has to be pictures  in the town hall I think now.
If not we do have some over at the church that uh,  maybe I can get for you to see.
Um,  and um, the-  there was uh, a jail also.
And uh- Yeah.
Yeah it had the little town hall, it was a little old building about half way big as this room.
So- Uh-huh.
And where you come in from over town coming around the curve, there- years ago it used to be um-    What was in there now?
I w- I wanna say a barber shop.
But there was a Chinese man that moved here.
Uh, years ago, his name was RD-NAME-2.
And he had a building there,  a convenience store like and a little club.
And a lot of little- It was three buildings right in that area.
And they tore all of that down.
Mm-hm.
Ooh that's been some years back.
Uh, when you're coming from Tarboro and you come around the curve to go  to the left.
Right-  the area over on the side.
Mm-hm.
Yeah that need to be torn.
Torn down.
Yeah.
The RD-NAME-2 used to live in there.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Not RD-NAME-2's family.
Uh,  let's see um-  You know when you start talking about-  Ooh I'll tell you about a history about that, the kids used to stop there to that house to the old lady, and she would sell 'em grapes.
Off of her grape vine.
I cannot think of  her first name.
Yeah RD-NAME-2 w- I was born and raised with RD-NAME-2.
Uh-huh.
Been known him all his life.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Miss RD-NAME-2.
I don't know, uh,  not- it's not RD-NAME-2's mother though.
Uh-uh.
No.
But- But uh, you know who I- I think the RD-NAME-2 he's talking about is RD-NAME-4.
From Virginia.
Mm-hm.
Years ago she used to be a majorette in one of our high school bands.
And uh, her parents and everything was v-  her mother was very active.
Uh-huh.
RD-NAME-2.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That would be good.
She'll be here because there will be a class reunion coming soon.
Uh-huh.
Um, I have to check my  paper.
Is it a fourth of July weekend, RD-NAME-1?
For the class reunion.
We were talking about it the other day.
For uh, RD-SCHOOL-3.
The school I graduated from.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yes.
No no no.
she Went to school afterwards, uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Princeville school.
uh-huh.
I went over to East Tarboro.
For the e- uh, grammar school and high school.
Mm-hm.
Yeah that was a- RD-SCHOOL-3 was a high school.
Princeville school to elementary.
Which was also in Tarboro.
And uh- No no it was uh, Princeville- C B Martin.
Tar- I mean,  Tarboro High, you know the schools were separated then.
And um,  We got Stocks later.
And those were the schools.
Uh-huh.
I went to Pat-  tillo.
Princeville.
And those were the ones.
Mm-hm.
And believe it or not i was the youngest  black  girl on Tarboro school board.
I was the first  girl bus driver  in Tarboro.
Mm-hm.
And the strangest thing,  there used to be people like sitting on a corner on Main Street, and they used to call it Chris' corner, anybody can tell you that lived here years.
Every afternoon I come by on my route with the kids they would stand up and cheer.
They had to build the, um,  brakes and accelerator up for me because my legs were so short.
But I learned to drive very early.
At sixteen.
Mm-hm.
For the  Tarboro City Schools.
Uh, I was about seventeen.
I- seventeen.
Cause I started very very early.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I was in a school.
And then when I graduated uh, in fifty-nine  I went to Fayetteville State University.
And from Fayetteville I went to Shaw.
Uh-huh.
And I graduated from Shaw.
I went to Fayetteville two years.
After then, uh, after you know, graduation and everything I went to college, I came out I went to Washington, For a few years, a- you know how you wanna move away?
And my mother said, I'll let you try it for two years.
And uh,  second year, They came and packed me up , and brought me back to Tarboro.
But I'm so thankful and glad, because they could see much further than I.
But I liked Washington,  I learned my way around even there, I would get on the bus and all I needed was direction and I would ride from one end to the other until I  learned the city.
You know and I could drive there just like I drive here.
You know.
It wasn't uh,  anything strange to me cause I wasn't scared about getting lost.
As long I got some gas and some money in my pocket I'm going.
And I would do that, I would travel  I used to love to travel.
DC I worked with the uh,  a preschool program, I also worked with Drug Fair.
and uh- Drug Fair was a uh,  like a um,  Eckerd's.
Yeah.
But that's the name of the uh, drug stores up there.
And I enjoyed working that.
I got a chance to meet a lot of people, you know coming through.
And there was a lot of lawyers that lived- uh, not lived but  had their offices  by.
And they would come in  and we had all kinds of conversation.
But I really learned you know, the area.
And Washington.
But I- I l- I used to love it, you know before everything got so  traumatic and everything going on, you know.
So my mother got scared for me living there and so that's why I came back home.
And when I came back home I start um,  I- I worked with Martin County doing sub work for a while, I worked with Edgecombe County,  and I also worked in Rocky Mount.
I worked with Rocky Mount, Wilson, and Edgecombe Nash Wilson area for thirty-two years  with a preschool program.
And w- Right.
Then I w- then I went to social work.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Right.
And uh,  after becoming involved with Head Start, I went to UNC for- uh, took classes for a long time there.
And uh, I got my uh, degree in  social work.
And I supervised.
ooh,  we had- uh, at that time we had six centers,  and we had social workers  working  in each of the centers where we would uh,  recruit children from the different areas.
and different programs.
My office was in Rocky Mount.
Uh-huh.
Every day.
Mm-hm.
Okay uh, I had to train the uh, social workers, and also teach the parents on um, early  childhood.
And did all types of so- uh,  social services work  uh, type information to them.
You know how to become a better parent,  um,  uh, parent- control parenting, and uh,  how to get a job.
Uh, how to do interviews, How to take care of your home, how to secure a home, and all types of-  every basic thing that you can think of that a parent would need in order to survive with their children.
And we did health workshops for them, where we would bring in the health department and any type of resource area that would be needed.
We would bring them in  with us to do workshops.
And that was most enjoyable.
Mm-hm.
Uh,  dealing with people.
Seeing people better themselves.
And it was really really  rewarding.
Because a lot of the young people like went to Head Start- They're grown now, they might not remember you completely  but they remember some things that  they did.
And it comes back to them you know, and say,  do you remember me  when I was in Head Start?
And believe it or not, a lot of 'em, I try to keep up with them.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
A lot of people that had children  in the program and might have  had problems  you know of getting services and things that they need.
We had  all-  all  facets of the area of children with special needs.
We had teachers to work with those parents and the children, and refer the children to the services that they need.
And some of them  uh,  like when growing up,  you can just about tell  you know, how a person's gonna turn out if you be with them for a while.
And really some of 'em have done beautiful.
Beautiful.
You know,  and  has come back to tell you,  I thank you  you know, for working with me.
And even the parents, they tell me right now about their children how well they're doing.
And  I am real thankful for that,  for them, because that's what the program was about.
To help people better themselves.
You know and put them on the right track.
Mm-hm.
Thirty-two years.
Mm-hm.
Every day.
All types of training you ever  dreamed of, you received it.
Mm-hm.
Yeah five years ago.
Right- a year before the flood.
Mm-hm.
Very.
I didn't think it was  gonna be like this, you know.
But um,  at one time,  I think it was the first year I just couldn't take it.
You know.
Just being-  sitting, you know and not doing anything.
So I got involved in volunteering and  working with the school system for a long time.
And then uh, the position came open for a  c- uh, commissioner in this area.
And I saw that  there is a area that I could help, you know, and doing.
As I told you before, uh,  I was asked to uh,  help with the uh,  historic  planning for the museum.
And I thought about it I said, now do I wanna get involved in this?
And I need to do something, you know, because I care about the area.
So I  went down and I volunteered on that committee.
And after being there I really loved it.
Because we had planned everything you could think of for the museum.
And to see that it would come out you know, right.
Had real good people representing, volunteering on that committee.
And I was really amazed, I enjoy- my husband can tell you,  I was ready to go every time we had a meeting.
We had a person came out of Durham, His name is RD-NAME-3, RD-NAME-4.
I mean he would come down and volunteer and help us every month, he was be there.
Waiting and ready.
You know, he- we kept in close communication with each other.
He was really one hundred percent access to that organization.
And I tell you when he resigned it just tore me up.
I tell you.
But uh, he's doing well.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
He resigned um,  let's see,  it was last- I think it was last year.
Yeah.
By the beginning of the year.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah we was very active.
Mm-hm.
We would uh, plan  you know,  uh, how we um,  uh,  viewed-  vision, rather  that the um,  building and everything would come out.
Uh, positions that would be needed, we had already put that down.
You know, how would uh, this person be uh,  advised,  and what kind of training  you know, this person need.
What we plan to do in the museum, whether we're gonna sell  uh, memorabilia,  uh, any type of booklets or  you know, programs.
All of this had been planned and- and down in writing.
We had a beautiful person uh, to volunteer that was our secretary.
Her name is uh, RD-NAME-3.
She was our secretary.
She took excellent m- minutes and everything.
And when the um,  committee just-  we just broke up and it was really  something.
Cause all of us look forward to it.
There was a young man on the um, planning um, board f- with us that-  RD-NAME-1, he teach school in Rocky Mount but his- Yeah, RD-NAME-2.
Uh-huh, he has a business also here.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Yeah we all met  as I say every month.
Mm-hm.
No.
Uh-uh.
Well uh, first we wanted to know if uh,  we had the consent  of the board and the mayor on what we were doing.
Because it's almost like individual, it's self supporting really.
And um,  seemed like there was some friction there that  you know, wasn't pleasing to what we're all about.
So that's-  that's what happened there.
And we just  you know-  we just left it.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
Right.
But uh, all of the uh, plans and everything,  we had  gone forward and put it in writing and everything.
I hope so.
Because they were very good plans.
And um,  the, uh, copy of this uh,  should be at the town hall now.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Right, last year.
Last year.
See uh, I was just voted in uh, November.
In November.
And uh,  I, uh, came in d-  I think my first meeting was in December.
Because it had to be after um,  the fourteenth if I'm not mistaken, fourteenth or fifteenth before I could be sworn in.
Because of the time frame of  you know, the term of the office.
To run for commissioner?
Because I saw a need where I really n- I could  help.
You know it was a lot of dissension going on in the beginning that wasn't good for the people.
uh, the community at all.
And see we're working on that, now.
Every minute of the day, I'm serious.
Because I saw there was change need to be made.
In order for us to progress.
And I think we're doing well.
Well.
Very much so.
I don't mean to take uh, credit  of everything, but if it's not going right, I'm not gonna be a part of it.
And uh,  I'm a very  strong stickler about  people not doing things the way they supposed to be.
And not giving the people a chance to have word in what's their community is about.
Right.
That's exactly right.
That's exactly right.
Mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
Uh, doing today to seeing that uh,  we get ecstablished  with right credentials and the right people to push the town forward.
You know.
Because there's still a lot of work need to be done.
And we're doing it, but it's step by step thing.
To make sure that we do it right, you know.
And  keep everything in place like it's supposed to be.
Because I know you've heard it, just like everybody say it's been a lot of dissension  going on that  wasn't needing to be.
You know.
And um,  we're working on it and at first you know, it seemed like nobody was listening.
But uh-  And I'm not a uh,  uh,  really personal like that but I speak out.
You know, you might not like me, but I'm gonna tell you what's right, you know whether you listen or not.
But if I say it long enough and loud enough,  maybe you know, I get your attention.
And I think I've- I'm- I'm getting that little by little.
It's working out, I tell you that.
Oh,  right now you know we got the park going on, they've gotten uh,  not the foundation but they've got it laid out now how they gonna do the uh,  baseball park area, and you know we supposed to house the senior citizens building over here also.
And they're working on that, and we just got a grant believe it- it was in yesterday's paper.
From the state.
And um- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Mr.
RD-NAME-1  uh,  made the picture yesterday and presented to the public.
And that's good.
Mm-hm.
We've gotten a lot of um,  drainage area  taken care of like in Southern Terrace.
That project  uh, has almost finished.
And um,  w-  now we're gonna- with the new grant he got we're gonna do some  additional senior citizen housing area.
Over where the Lowes uh, Court, do you know where that is?
If you go down Neville Street,  make a left, and the row of houses on your left well it's supposed to be across from there, additional housing.
Mm-hm.
Right.
That's right.
Mm-hm.
And um,  we've got area over near where the funeral home is.
Hemby funeral home.
Uh, we're looking forward to businesses coming in, you know over in that area.
So- and I see they're working on the store down  on that road  going uh-  uh, h- ho-  Road.
That's the name of it, uh, if you over the train tracks, and down that road you'll see.
It used to be a store there um,  convenience store and gas station.
And uh, saw they was remodeling it.
And you know that's extra business coming into the town.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Well, I can see a lot of progress in uh,  you know from  people not complaining so much about every thing.
We uh, do have a drug  problem in the area.
And the police uh,  you know,  they are working diligently with the sheriff department in Edgecombe County.
And they are trying to clean it up.
I mean wherever you go now you know you got pockets of it.
And we're trying to take it step by step to see that it's done.
One of the um, motions  we made in the meeting is that  the drug houses where you see people hanging all the time and just demolishing  the building, uh, we've had one house that has been closed up.
Nailed up.
And- and the reason for this they had uh,  disturbance going on in the community, shooting, where some of the senior citizens were really scared to go out of their house.
But that has been taken care of, I say ninety-nine percent.
And they're still working on it.
And I  think this is excellent, this is good.
Because at one time, uh,  the-  I call 'em the drug people had came into the community and they was hanging out  on the streets, all down here in the  fork by the stoplight.
You know uh,  uh,  fellows hanging out there.
And uh, some of 'em even had nerve enough to dr- if you stop at the stop thing, come walking up to your car.
You know.
So all of this has been  wonderful, taken care of because they don't do that no more, they don't hang around.
And- Yeah.
Who's who.
That's right.
That's right.
Yeah.
They have done a lot of cleaning up.
At one time you know they had something like a gang violence with the uh, boys from  one side of town to the other side of town.
And Princeville.
And um,  you know, it's really strange people didn't know that all of this  type  thing was going on but that's- that's being handled.
We had uh,  two students shot.
One was killed.
Yeah uh,  was it last year or year before last now RD-NAME-1?
One re- two recently.
Th- they had something like I understand a graduation party going on, but this w-  they had it at a little club down in the country in Conetoe.
And uh,  one boy came in there and they say he fired the gun, shot a boy, and the bullet went through one s-  uh, child to another and both of them died.
But you know things like that you know, uh, you just don't need it.
You don't need it.
