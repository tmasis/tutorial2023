Although they worked it out and everything.
Okay, so  what's that?
Four hundred thirty-six dollars and  seventy-two cents?
Subtract- well, minus  forty-nine dollars and  forty-six cents?
And what'd that give me?
Hey, but would you be able to do that without like that- that paper right in front of you.
