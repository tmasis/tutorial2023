Hm.
But see, it's one little- Just one opportunity opens up a door, you just never know.
Um, where were your parents born?
Where were your father and mother born?
And your dad?
Oh.
You're a southern boy  at heart.
And what- what'd your parents do?
And dad?
Okay.
I'm gonna-  That's all I need to write.
Alright.
So we're just gonna- kind of just talk.
Um, So tell me a little bit about  Bruce Place as w- as you remember growing up.
Mm.
Mm, sorry to hear that.
Mm.
So,  couple of things I wanna ask you about.
When you say you played outside, what'd y'all do?
Like what kind of games and stuff?
Mm-mm.
Like what?
Mm-hm, okay.
Mm, yeah.
So you would sit on the hill, wait til a car come, and roll a tire into the street?
So the car would hit the t- so you would try not to hit- you try to dodge the car?
What- what was the objective?
How do you win?
You were mischievous.
So not so much bad just you like to cause mischief.
But you were bad, you were bad.
So you the third.
Right.
Cause it's  two d- I mean, you doing all this versus oh just one little thing.
So I can- I can just imagine little RD-NAME-2.
I'm still going on the h- hill, cause my tire just blew out the other day.
Some- there was a- there's something in the road and the car in the other lane ran over it and it came into my lane and hit my tire so I had to buy a new t- It blew my whole tire out.
Like it poked a- like the hole was this big.
And so, then I'm just like, oh my g- Cause I can just imagine this like- So right now, you know, that's a sore-  that's a- that's a sore spot right now.
The- it wasn't you?
But I- I just think that was little RD-NAME-2, that was little RD-NAME-2 reincarnated making my tire flat.
Yeah.
I mean, as the director of safety.
Uh, thank you director of safety.
Uh, yeah, I used to roll tires and- and try to get people to slam on breaks, um.
So did y'all live in an apartment, did you live in a house?
A rowhouse?
And so- and it was like a lot of kids in the neighborhood?
Oh that's good.
Mm-hm.
Did y'all do anything together as like a neighbor- I mean, besides like, play did y'all like-  like have a community center or  did y'all like- cookouts or something?
So now going back, cause you said there was gang activity like,  turf wars.
So was that a big thing?
Ten.
Oh okay.
Cause they know something about to pop off.
Oh wow.
So everybody kind of looked out for everybody.
Mm.
Right.
So tell me about school.
Cause-  Elementary school, let's start there, where'd you go to elementary school?
Okay.
Oh wow.
Mm-hm.
Paddle.
They had a better football team?
Did you play basketball too?
Okay so you had to give up one for the other.
So tell me about-    tell me about your most fun time in school?
I can believe it.
Mm.
At RD-SCHOOL-2.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Nah- You don't know nobody.
Mm-hm.
And then  were you on varsity?
So how did- Okay, so  tell me about playing basketball, cause I'm'a ask you about basketball in a minute.
Mm-mm.
The daddy.
He played for the daddy.
Not- not the son.
This the eightie- oh, I'm- we're in the nineties.
Yeah, the daddy, mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
What position?
I was gonna ask were you a center.
What'd you wanna play, power forward?
Or small forward?
So four or five.
You just didn't wanna play three.
You point guard.
Mm-hm.
Right.
And he saw it as making you- giving you opportunities, yup.
What's your favorite college team?
Really?
Love it, I love it.
So you're a Wizards fan?
So what do you think about the season?
W- what- think- w- what- what you think gonna happen this-  Jodie Meeks?
He was good.
I went to the  preseason game the other day, he was real good.
Yeah.
Go- go Fri- Friday is Knicks, and then- Friday is Knicks and then Sunday is Cleveland.
And the tickets aren't that bad, I think I'm'a go Sunday, cause I- I gotta write.
Preseason.
Go to StubHub, Ticketmaster.
Cheap.
I paid  six bucks  for tickets.
Um, It was a Chinese team on Monday.
But they were g- Jodie Meeks showed out.
I mean.
Yeah, it was kind of- I mean, we coulda left- we coulda-  we coulda left in third quarter.
But what do you think about-  think about the outlook of the season?
Think how- how they- h- for you how they end the season and then what you think is gonna happen for this season.
Game seven?
Hm.
But game six was good.
John Wall.
Mm-hm.
Oh.
No, but right- so, right when you were born though wasn't that Phil Chenier, wasn't that the year?
That was- but you were like, three.
So it- it didn't matter, yeah.
When they went just all the way down hill.
But now there's hope.
Okay so talk about Bo- but think about Boston, they've re-tooled.
I'm not sure Kyrie Irving is a better choice than Isaiah Thomas.
Only because chemistry matters,  then you got Gordon Hayward coming and then they lost some of their defensive prowess.
I don't know.
Mm-hm.
Yup.
What about Cleveland, what you think?
Sh- show me what Derrick Rose did in New York to tell me-  to make me feel better about him being in Cleveland.
Who?
Cleveland looks good on paper, right?
You got Derrick Rose, you got LeBron, you got  D Wade.
But when you put all that-  but now  to me sometimes having too much superstar power, that's too many-  that's too many cooks in the kitchen.
Because  everybody wanted to be the guy.
Mm-mm.
That's why they had that whole- Think about when John Wall and Bradley Beal kind of had they little  tiff, right?
But then when Bradley Beal conceded and said, this is John Wall's team, but we the- we're the back court, think about where they went after that.
Cleveland,  they all over the place, it's a mess.
I think they're vulnerable, I think they're vulnerable more than they've been in the last couple of years.
I think so too.
That February game was crazy.
Were you there?
I had a  dinner that night so I couldn't go but we watched, it was crazy.
Yup.
What about the Redskins?
Tell me-  talk about- talk about football.
Cause football is your heart, it seems.
Mm.
Are you a season ticket holder?
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Cause they show you what they wanna sh- Yup.
And you miss all that could be happening.
I've-  I've-  So sometimes like I go to the basketball game and then I'll go ho- Like, when I don't have anything to do which is not often, but I'll go home and rewatch the game, and I'm like, oh my god that felt so different being there cause you see it from a totally different angle.
Oh I'm a- I'm a basketball- I'm a- Oh, we can talk basketball all day.
I am a basket- I am a Wizards fan.
After the Wizards I'm a Spurs fan because I was a Timmy fan.
Um,   and I'm a Popovich fan.
Um, I lo- but I also love the Warriors.
Like,  if it's Warriors and- if it's Warriors and Cavaliers I will go Warriors all day.
I'm- cause I'm not a LeBron fan.
I am- I'm a LeBron hater because I think LeBron is a- too much of a LeBron fan.
I don't like people like that.
I don't- but I don't like people like that.
And I love Golden Sta- I love that nobody is over themselves and nobody is good enough that they can't step back  for the good of the team.
And so I appreciate that, because it's about- at the end of the day it's about the team.
And you can take all the individual accolades, and they do that, because it's about the team.
And so when your team is the better- when your team is better,  the individual performances will ps-  will shine.
That's why I don't like- I'm not a LeBron fan any day of the week.
But oh we can talk basketball all day.
Okay, but I know we not gon- So let's- we'll move on, so-  so tell me about- um,   So when- when the- the season really starts we will be  most definitely talking about-  So RD-NAME-2 and I used to talk about the games,  um, after- after the games.
Yeah, like the day after we would always talk about the games.
Like I'm- cause I'm also a sta- I do data, so I'm also- But stats- but I love stats.
So I think basketball has some of the most interesting stats.
And I love like, percentages, I love just-  The numbers part of it is fascinating to me too.
Um, but anyway.
Um, so tell me a little bit about your family.
Do you think- are you a close family or y'all kind of-  Wow.
Mm-hm.
But you're not close to him, so that- Mm.
Oh y'all celebrate anything.
Y'all celebrate cause it's Tuesday.
Oh we gonna celebrate.

Hm.
Tell me about the wedding.
Oh.
How many people were there?
Oh that's a good size.
That's a- That's enough.
Cause you get past that and it's just too much.
Mm-hm.

Very much so.
Do you have kids?
Girl or boy?
Does she have you wrapped around her little finger?
Yeah, she does, that's- that's a yes.
That's a yes.
Because she's doing what she's supposed to do.
Right.
Is she into boys yet?
No not yet that you don't know of.
Which is different.
She may- I mean, I'm just being- Look, we work around kids, right?
Um,  and so we're the- we're the people that the kids go to when they don't go to their parents.
And so we know about all the kids who like, you know, I really like this person, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
You did it  when you were younger.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Hey RD-NAME-2.
You did it.
Right, but I get it.
Times twenty.

As long as you're not ignorant to that fact.
Okay.
Cause you thought she was a perfect angel.
Mm-hm.
Yup.

And that's wonderful.
Where-  Does she wanna go to college?
Mm-hm.
Right.

Let's- so let's transition from family.
How did you get to-  You're kind of in this job, right?
So, in safety, and like, people just don't walk into, I'm gonna be in safety.
How did you kind of get into this career path?
Was it through college, or how did you get here?
Mm-hm.
Hm.

So that was when you were close to a dead body, do you ever feel like there was a time when you  like, were like, oh my god I'm about to die?
Like when you were in a situation  where you thought you were gonna die or get killed?
So you were always- you were good.
That's a good thing.
That's probably best.
So let's talk about DC for a few minutes.
Um,  you've grown up here, you s- you've seen a lot of things being kind of, you know, in your job and stuff.
How has the city changed?
Or do you think it's changed?
So do you feel like the city is getting better or worse?

Mm.
Yup.
Mm-hm.

Yeah.
Yeah.
So let me ask you a couple-  I- I totally agree.
I- um,  I think it's really interesting and like to hear- people who have lived here for so long to hear  what they think about it, right?
Cause  I don't really have a stake, I wasn't born here, I went to college here and I work here.
So my view,  I- even going to college here now being here now is still very d- like, it's different, right?
From when I went to college here ten years ago to now.
Um, and I'm-  I'm fascinated, like  not necessarily in a good way.
Um,  but then to hear people who've  grown up here all their lives to talk about it.
And they're like,  my city's changing.
My city's- you know, it is what- you know.

And they sponsored-  they sponsored it for her they gave it as long as she could post- they could post a  picture on their Instagram to tell her good luck for the competition.
It was really cute.
That's how I- I didn't know they were sold in grocery stores until- until RD-NAME-4 brought it to my attention.
Yup.
Okay, so what- do you have any specific carry outs that you like?
You know, some people- like, they have they specific ones on this street, they have to go to this only one.
So no, no I don't even do that.

And all the clubs that have names are- um,  were- So, you know, it was Greater Washington and it was Metropolitan Police.
