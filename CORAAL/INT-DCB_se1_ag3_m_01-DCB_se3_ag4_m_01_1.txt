Cause her mom was tired.
But  it was-  it was definitely interesting.
O- one of the interesting things for me like when I went in there was, um,  you know, you go around and you start noticing other things outside of the museum.
You know, you start looking, you know, and you start noticing, you start seeing what products  are being sold.
You know I looked at- I looked at everything.

Cause our history interwines with- our history is American history, so.

And I always say  one of my favorite little sayings is United States of Amnesia.
I wanna go remember what-  I wanna remember!
So what about like like with the music thing  so yeah you just gave me some really good history.
I felt like I was in New York or something.
They way you just broke it down like that with the music cause not a lot of people know.
Like I didn't know all of that.
I mean I knew a lot- I mean I knew s- some of it but not all of it like dang.
Mm-hm.
