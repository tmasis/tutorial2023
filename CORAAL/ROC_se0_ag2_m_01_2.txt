So,  in comparison, it's- it's, they've, those areas have worked very hard to create  a mystique.
Part of it is building into the  the community relationship with the schools.
So, the schools become a very,  become almost a rallying point for the town.
Um,  it's a gathering place and they, they- the schools are are located in such a way that it's close to the town centers.
So,  people are constantly being brought in towards the town center.
And then, everything is very controlled to look a certain way.
Um.
Pittsford Wegmans.
My wife always jokes that  you know, you can't just roll into Pitts Wegmans in your pajamas because you don't know who you will see.
It could be a judge, it could be a lawyer, it could be a doctor, it could be your mom's best friend.
And, so you have to  um,  be presentable when you go in  because you don't know who you will come across.
Um,  in places like Henrietta, um,  like Greece, um, more so towards the westside,  um,  some of that,    I guess, uh, stuffy presentation.
Hoity toity-ness if you will.
Um.
Isn't necessarily there.
And it's more of um,  a family feel.
It's ne- less formal.
So, if you  show up in  you know, your pajamas cause it's seven o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and you're just getting your breakfast  at Wegmans.
Nobody bats an eye.
Pittsford, they look at you like you're a little bit crazy.
And, it's because it's a very,  they work to keep a formal appearance and look to themselves.
Um,  in terms of the effect that that has on the students.
