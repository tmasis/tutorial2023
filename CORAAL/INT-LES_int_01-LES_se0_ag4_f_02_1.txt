I interviewed a woman who was in one of the- an extra at the age of like, eleven.
In the movie.
And they only hired a, like, Italian Americans, because they were recreating this, like,  this scene, and she was- her- she was Italian.
And sh- and as l- as like, a little eleven year old, she dressed up in the old costume and like, walked up and down the street.
Isn't that funny?
I- I went back and watched the movie, I was like, I couldn't believe it.
Cause I live on RD-ADDRESS-6.
It's just right there, yeah.
Right around the corner.
I don't believe it.
I know, I love it.

Um, I've heard about the one like, Orchard Street kind of area.

That you were off  on the weekends at a museum, or something like that.

Mm-hm.
Right.
Yeah.
Some people think that, right.
Yeah.
What do you consider it to be?
Yeah.
I mean, the term East Village I think wasn't even created until like, the seventies.
So at the time you were growing up, I don't think there was another name  for the neigborhood, except  Lower East Side.
Yeah.
So it's more- I think newer people that view the north of Houston as the East Village, and this different thing.
Like, you talk to folks that have been here- yeah, that have been around for a while, they say, no it's all Lower- and historically it was all one neighborhood.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Oh.
Oh, really?
Really?
When was this?
In the sixties?
Interesting.
Very interesting.
Yes.
How did that affect your family then?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, where your parents, um,  strict or lax as parents?
When were you allowed to kind of go out and explore in the neighborhood, or did you stay close to home?
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
With a flashlight?
Okay.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
But they supported you.
Yeah.
