Awesome.
RD-NAME-3's  mom.
She's so cute.
Um.
Okay.
So, we were talking about the community.
So, we've got these new folks moving into the neighborhood, right?
That um,  have more money,  here for the night life,  you know, Some people talk about gentrification.
So,  uh, are those folks part of the Lower East Side community?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, if you make an effort.
Then it's all good.
Right.
I can't believe that.
Yeah .
Yeah.
I wish I had known those were the cops.
I would have come over and given them some shit.
I mean.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I like that.
This one?
That's amazing.
Did you do that?
Okay.
You come up with the concept .
That's great.
Now, what's- what's uh, the significance of Third D?
Okay.
Why that corner in particular?
Why?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Really?
Yeah.
Really?
I didn't know that.
Crazy.
Now, uh.
I-  uh.
At any point in your life, or- or- I mean.
I know that there are  gangs operating in the neighborhood.
And were you involved with them?
Or were they are strong presence?
Is that.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Did you ever join one when you were young?
I mean, it's- just want protection or something right?
Okay.
Got it.
Got it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure it will.
So, uh  I always ask people, um  to tell me a couple of places in the neighborhood,  that are really meaningful to them.
like places where you used to spend time.
And you- think, maybe just- you t- you just told me one which was the Avenue D.
Just- s- e- What's that?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
He's your godson.
Okay.
Yeah.
Jesus.
Yeah.
Ho- how do they g- do it?
They're hustling.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
And what's your advice for a kid coming up now who's sixteen.
On Avenue D.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure, yeah.
Everybody is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
But.
Yeah.
Hi.
It's a little kitten.
So sweet.
I have a black cat too.
Really cute.
Sorry, I'm distracted.
I really like cats.
Um.
I wanna ask you your opinion about uh, housing in the neighborhood.
I think I told you that some of the groups I'm working with are interested in  you know, housing and,  and what gets built in the neighborhood.
And you obviously seen  some of these  big tall buildings going up, luxury.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Right.
So you said you were,  uh, when I talked to you on the phone earlier, you said you were down by Delancey Street.
So, have you seen right right by the Williamsburg bridge.
No- No, not the blue building.
Um.
You're right by the bridge on Delancey.
There's all these parking lots.
They're surrounded by fences.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
So, that's a lot that's owned by the city,  that people have been trying to develop for  as long as you've lived here.
Longer.
The city bought it in like the sixties.
And they haven't been able to build anything there because the community has been kind of divided  over  what to build there.
and it's sort of about  uh,  some people wanna put up affordable housing, low income housing.
Some people wanna put up  something different.
Maybe like the blue building, or maybe you know, something for like the middle class, or whatever.
People  are  conflicted about that.
And so, I ask everybody that I interview,  if you, you've seen those lots.
It's a really big space.
What do you think should be  built there?
And it doesn't have to be housing.
It could be housing plus, you know, other things.
Some people maybe want a  Home Depot, some people want  you know, a movie theater.
If it were up to you, what would you build on a lot on the Lower East Side?
What does the community need?
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Get 'em playing a game or.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
And what about housing?
Do you think that there's also a need for housing in the neighborhood?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
I know.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Seriously.
Yeah.
Yeah.
