Didn't you ever use one potato, two potato?
Oh, that was when you were younger?
What were some used when you were younger?

Boys would never learn  those rhymes that they used for jumping rope or?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Did you ever uh, play any other games with chasing?
Was that a regular game or was that just for fun?
That's great.
Well how about baseball.
Did you ever play  in any organized teams or anything?

Oh, yeah uniforms.
Whoa.
Hm.
uh Do you remember any time when you were in an exciting  uh football game or basketball er- yeah, basketball game that was  where it was close or something, that you particularly remember, that you could tell about?
How did that go?
Gee whiz.
Aw.
What position did you play?
How about basketball?
Where were you?
You look like you're tall enough to be a good center.
That's one thing I never was, was an athlete, so I always admire somebody that can  be good at sports.
Uh  what  uh, do you watch television?
Watch it now.
What's one of your favorite shows?
Or what are a couple of your favorite shows?
That's too much.
Mm-hm.

Oh, that's pretty funny.
Oh that's pretty good.
Mm- how did it come out though?
How did the whole story go?
Do you remember?
Yeah, that is funny.
Do you remember any of the other shows- adventure shows that you watched?
Or one of the movies that you could tell a story of?

Mm-hm.
Mm.
How come?
Cause they eat too much?
Wow.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, what did you study in school?
That you remember?
Only- Rather be-  That's pretty good.
How about uh   in elementary school.
Do you remember what the subjects were there?
Do you remember what kids did after school was out  in elementary school?
What would you do?
Help themselves.
Ah, that's pretty cool  Do you think kids do about the same things nowadays as they did then?
Hm.
Um  when you- do you remember anywhere through school  uh, that you ever had a teacher that hollered a lot?
Lucky.
Do you remember the best teacher you ever had?
Did you ever have a really good one?
Is there- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Boy.
Oh that's great.
Mm.
Did you ever have a teacher you just couldn't stand?
Mm.
Did you ever have- were you ever in a class where the kids played a trick on the teacher?
Practical joke or anything?
Were you in on it?
What'd they do?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
What else did they do?
Mm-hm.
Yeah, that's great.
Some of those are really funny with those kids too.
Yeah.
Oh really?
Probably wouldn't mess with them though.
Yeah.
Mm.
It helped you grow up though.
Hm.
Was it- did they move you some place?
Oh gee.
Hm.
Oh really?
Well I can remember some experiences like that, too.
One tough kid  I used to mark his spelling test, and he used to make me give him a hundred every time.
That's the- I mean the teacher would have us give  the test to the kid in front, you know.
I always got his.
He would say, give me a hundred, or I'll beat you up after school.
Yeah I could .
Um  when you were a kid,  was there a- a group of kids that you used to associate with?
You know, it was always your same bunch  of kids?
Mm-hm.
This uh group of kids that was around where you lived  uh,  was there one who was looked up to as the leader?
You know,  there was the one that sort of  decided what you were going to do?
Someone ?.
What would make a kid get in that position?
What was there about him?
That made him a leader?
Do you remember?
That was the main requirement.
Hm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
That helps.
Well how did he- how did he show himself as the leader?
I mean  how would he  act as a leader?
Uh, did any of those kids speak any foreign languages that you remember?
Were they all Negro kids?
Mm-hm.
Uh, could a new kid get into that group?
Suppose a new kid moved into the neighborhood.
And how would he go about it?
What would he do?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Hm-hm.
Do you ever see any of those people nowadays?
Mm-hm.
Is there a different group that you associate with now?
Really?
Hm.
Ah, kay.
Mm.
Well that quite often happens.
Some of the toughest kids turn out alright.
Should get-  make it through.
If you could uh, start your life over again, is there anything-  is there anything you'd do differently?
Mm.
Uh  what did you want to do when you were in school?
Did you have any idea what you wanted to be?
Yeah, those things happen.
Here's a question that will make you use your imagination a little.
If you had all the money you wanted in the world, what would you do with it?
Have you ever thought about that?
If I could give you one check  on the Chase Manhattan Bank or something.
What would you do with it?
Why not?
Mm.
That's your private- private thought, huh.
Um  let's talk about holidays for a minute.
Um  how do you celebrate Christmas?
Either now, or when you were a child.
Whichever you rem- you remember best.
Mm-hm.
A lot of 'em, huh?
Do you have a lot of relatives around here?
Mm-hm.
Your mother's side and your father's?
Mm-hm.
What was the best- oh go ahead.
Uh  what was the best Christmas present you ever got?
That you remember.
Let me ask you a similar one.
What if you could have  any Christmas present or birthday present that you wanted, what would you like?
Suppose you had a real rich uncle or something.
He wanted to give you a present.
What would you ask for?
Never thought about it, huh?
Mm.
Here's a question that's a little more serious.
Were you ever in a situation where you thought you might be killed or might die?
Dangerous spot, tight spot  of any kind.
Or sickness or anything.
Ah, yeah?
What happened?
Well, first, what happened?
Then how you felt about it.
If you don't mind.
Man  Wow.
What happened then?
What went through your mind?
What he do, didn't shoot?
Gee whiz.
Man.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
You've been in some scrapes, then.
Sometimes people say- when you talk about stuff like this some of the times people say, you know,  whatever is gonna happen, is gonna happen anyway.
No sense in worrying about it, or trying to do anything.
Do you agree with that?
Or?
Do you argue with that?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.
