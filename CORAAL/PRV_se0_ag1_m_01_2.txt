I think it is.
I don't think  we get enough  uh,  publicity because if it's the first black charter town, seems like somebody would  be tryna do something to try to restore all the stuff and but you don't see that.
It's just people came down just to see, and they saw it was nothing.
It was nothing to show  that it's  historic because everything was gone and- I would give it to  Tarboro.
That's the only way  that they're gonna progress.
I hate to say it, but they really need to go on and let Tarboro take it over.
Try to find out where all this mismanaged money is and  try to  do all the things that they promised that they were gonna do that never happened like,  sidewalks on all the streets and-  and repaving all those roads because a lot of those roads in Princeville still have  p-  New York size pot holes, and it's ridiculous.
Not really.
I think with growing up in Princeville,  Princeville should be  like a foot stool for-  for where you need to go.
Cause with the way everything is,  it should make you want to be somewhere  better.
And cause it's a nice com- it was a nice community, but now I don't see how people just  don't go to school or graduate and just stay there.
Because it's nothing there.
