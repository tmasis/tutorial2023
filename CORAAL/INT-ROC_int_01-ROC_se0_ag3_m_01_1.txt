So, um,    yeah what part of the city I guess  where y- did you grow up?
Ah, okay.
And what was that neighborhood like for like someone who  is not from Rochester?
How would you describe it?
Mm.
And then, um, you said you grew up there until your teenage years.
Where was the next  part of Rochester you live in?
Mm,  okay.
Um,  and  did you go to school in,  uh,  the neighborhoods?
Let's see,  I guess, so, did you go to school in the third ward?
Okay.
And what was interesting to you about  Binghamton?
Mm-hm.
Yeah, makes sense.
And then when you returned from Binghamton and kind of settled down,  uh,  what did you decide, I guess was,  uh, the next step for you maybe in terms of school, or?
Mm.
And so as far as,  um,  reducing narcotics go, do you think that Rochester has been moving in the right direction?
Maybe, let's say in the last ten years?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
No, it's-  it's totally fine.
Um, I just wanna follow up, um, on your  point about the black head on a  black body  and whether, or n- what do you think that the, uh,  presidency of Barack Obama  has done  to, um,    maybe improve the circumstances for,  uh, black people in this country?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Okay, um,  and moving I guess from bigger to smaller, what about on a local level in terms of  we've had leadership from people like Mayor Bill Johnson, and now we have Mayor Lovely Warren.
Do you think that, um,  I guess some of the work that they're doing,  or,  Mayor Lovely Warren , some of the work that she's doing is also improving on the  circumstances, or?
Um,  we talked a little bit about like, racism in this country, but, uh, I wanted to ask more specifically in Rochester,  uh,  the ways in which you think-  or well, first of all, if you think, uh, African Americans have to deal with a lot of racism or discrimination,  or had to, at some point,  you know, uh, maybe in the fifties, sixties, seventies.
Um, and in which ways do  those-  does it manifest?
Um, so like, people will say okay, uh,  for example, police brutality, right.
That's an example of  a ways in which we can see this racist system operating.
Um,  yeah.
I don't know, does that question make sense?
Yeah,  have you heard of the organization BLACK here?
Yeah, and what do you think of the work that they're doing within the community?
Mm,  okay.
Um,    I wanted to ask a question, you mentioned a while back that, um, you're fourth generation here.
Um, but your grandparents I'm assuming,  were they born here, or they-   Cool.
Okay.
So, okay.
Your grandmother came here and raised your-  um,  and your grand- great-grandfather came and helped her raise her children, right?
Um,  do you know maybe why they wanted to come to  Rochester in the first place?
Like what was- Yeah.
Um,  so are- is most of your family still here?
Or have they thought about moving?
Mm-hm.
Yeah,  and for you, you- you wanna stay put here for, you know,  I don't know, the next few decades or are you thinking maybe retire somewhere else?
Mm-hm.
Um,  there was one more question I wanted to ask about  Rochester in general  and that is, uh, m- what are your favorite aspects of Rochester?
Yeah,  thank you.
Um,  and then my last couple questions are more so language related.
Um,  and that is whether or not,  uh,  maybe you've perceived,  uh, certain Rochesterians to have an accent?
Or maybe you've been told by  people who are not from here  that you have an accent?
Mm-hm.
And so, black Americans  don't really have the accent but do  any white Americans you think have  an accent,  uh, that's kind of like  Rochesterian to you?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah,  I ask because of- I get mixed reviews from people, sometimes they say, you know, it's kind of nasaly, we talk-  you know, uh, feel like they talk through their nose or- And so I was just seeing if you had any perspective about- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Um,  so those are all the questions I have, but if you have any,  uh, last few comments you wanna say  you know, you're welcome to share 'em, about Rochester,  um, in general.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
Um,  I- I would like to ask at the end if you, uh, still consent to me  using this interview?
Yeah, okay.
Well, thank you, I appreciate it.
Yeah.
