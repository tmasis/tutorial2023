Uh, so, I interviewed um, a woman that lives in Village View.
Who was an ex- who liv- grew up on this block and she was an extra in The Godfather.
When they filmed it she was a little girl.
I know, and so I went and rented the movie and I watched it and it's- I knew it's- I didn't see her.
She sa- she's like yeah, you can maybe see me in the background, I didn't see her, but um.
I just thought it was so cool that they filmed it.
Filmed it there.
And I just- I can see- I mean, I see them everyday working on the  the building.
I was like how did they- how can they r- gut the whole building, like they must have I thought they  intimidated everybody to leave or something.
That makes more sense.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
But, do you like the-  the neighborhood?
I mean.
Yeah.
I guess there's some tension.
The  yuppies and    Right.

Well, is there anything else  you wanna-  you wanna tell me?
Anything else I need to know?
I'll see you around.
I really appreciate it.
This was really fun.
I like to he- to learn about people you know.
It's like you meet somebody, I mean, you don't really know what their life was like.
Or is like.
That's cool.
Thanks.
It was good.
It was in uh.
It was in  January.
Yeah.
It was in the winter.
And he was.
It was before he went in the hospital, um and he was  like  just about to go  I think into court to argue about getting kicked out of his place.
So, he was very.
He was agitated.
I mean, he was.
He was upset about all that stuff that was going on.
At the time, so that's like mainly what we talked about.
I know he's really different.
Is it because he's on medication?
Yeah, he's just very subdued.
What is he taking?
Is it valium or something?
But like something like that.
Yeah.
That's what I thought, only cause he's so, he's just very mellow.
Yeah.
I sensed that.
I saw his video too.
Di- have you seen his movie?
Some- some  filmmaker made a  movie about him, like just followed him around with the camera.
Yeah, and uh.
And he brought it over when I interviewed him.
And you know, said would I buy it and I bought it.
It's called Cowboy Stan.
Oh, yeah, I'll lend it to you, it was funny.
But.
But from that, I mean I talked to him, we talked like this and so I'd met him a few times, but then I watched the movie.
And so I got a better idea of.
He was a- he is a character.
Oh my God.
So funny.
Yeah, he's a funny guy.
But I f- I feel, I mean, I-  I feel bad seeing him now, because he's so.
He just seems not himself.
Really?
He got him in the hospital?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, he seems like a good guy.
