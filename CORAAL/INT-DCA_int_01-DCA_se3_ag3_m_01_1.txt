Okay, uh,  do you recall what kind of games you used to play when you were a kid, around  ten years old or so?
Child's games we're interested in especially.
What about marbles?
How did we- how did that work?
Oh yeah?
How did a kid go about playing marbles?
Were the marbles outside?
Were the marbles outside of the circle?
Was there a special name for your favorite shooter?
There wasn't a general name for everybody's favorite shooter that you recall?
How about a glass marble?
Is there a different name?
Did anybody ever use these uh,  m- metal ball bearings for a marble?
Around New York, they sometimes use that.
Call 'em stealies.
Stealie.
it's a ball bearing.
What about Hide and Seek?
How would you go about playing that?
Mm-hm.
Now pretend for a minute that I'm a foreigner, and I've never heard of Hide and Go Seek.
How would you tell me how you play it, s-  start to finish?
They hide while your- Mm.
It's hard to remember.
These kids game.
That's good.
Uh, was there any- uh- uh- Did a person want to be it?
Or did- was that a bad thing?
Mm-hm.
Did you ever use any rhymes to decide who was it?
One potato, two potato?
Engine Engine, or?
Racing for the-?
Did- was there any other  games that you played as you grew up older than that?
Was it more athletics or?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Did you play in art?
Mm-hm.
Good.
That's quite a run down.
Delved in a lot of things.
Um,  do you watch television?
Do you have any favorite programs?
Show that you particularly like?
Oh.
Cut it down a little huh?
Um, is there an adventure story or anything that  with a story in it that you can  relate?
See, what I'm after is I would like you to tell me an episode  of a- a story like Gun Smoke or Perry Mason.
Yeah?
Tell me about that one.
Oh!
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Don't have to concentrate.
Um, I don't wonder that you remember that one .
Most of his are.
Have you been to a movie recently?
What's that about?
Mm-hm.
In Cold Blood.
You didn't like it?
I've only read the book.
Didn't really do anything for me.
Is it close to the book?
Mm.
Hm.
Have to figure that one out.
No, I haven't.
My wife probably has.
She's a great reader.
Forget we're not limited technical stuff these days.
You say you have a dog?
Uh- We had a dog thirteen years.
Sad huh?
What's his name?
He ever done anything funny or amusing?
That you recall?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Little birdseed, huh?
Well, they're smart to do things like that.
Do you feed him, uh, canned dog food?
Worked twelve years, it can't be harmful.
Huh.
Is that right?
Hm, that's good.
Do you remember  your grammar school, the things you studied there?
I can remember penmanship, but in my case, it didn't do much good.
What use is it these days, right?
Do you remember what the kids would do after school was out?
Mm-hm.
Did kids play ?
Kids are great that way.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Do kids do the same sorts of things today, as far you know?
You ever have a teacher that hollered a lot?
Mm-hm.
Hm.
You, uh, recall  uh, any time that you in particular  singled out for a lambasting?
Ooh.
Hm.
So you think it was probably  fair?
Mm.
Can you remember the best teacher you ever had?
Hm.
What is it that makes a good teacher?
Think back ??.
That's okay.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
You're lucky to have so many.
Yeah, I think everybody feels that way.
When they think back.
Was there ever a teacher that you just couldn't stand?
Remember any cases where the kids in the class played a trick on the teacher?
Put any tacks on the seat or anything of that nature?
Never to use that excuse.
That's pretty good.
When you were a kid, was there a certain n- or-  either as a younger child or as a  teenager,  was there a bunch of kids that-  that you associated with?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
.
Was there  a- a way that  new kids could have gotten into that group?
Mm-hm.
Could uh-  Did any of them, sort of, make this  intimate group that you have that you went to movies with- were with all the time, did  any of them get into that ??
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I'm going to cut you off.
So.
was- did the-  those kids have to do anything special to get into your group, or they just start hanging around.
Or how did that work?
Do you ever see any of these guys ?
Mm-hm.
Are there, uh-  is there a- another group of people  that you associate with now?
.
Mm-hm.
That's great.
Are there any caucasians in any of these groups?
Yes.
It's good when you don't have to.
What about your childhood friends?
Is that so?
