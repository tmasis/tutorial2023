Okay.
And  you can think of this as pretty informal.
Um,  I just really  wanna get a sense of different people's experiences growing up here.
Uh, the questions are  open ended,  so feel free to take it wherever you want.
I usually start off with questions about where you were born, where you grew up, and then  move into some more general,  uh, questions about Rochester  and  language.
So,  um,  yeah  feel free to-  uh, if you need to  take a break, take a break,  but also just  to elaborate in any kind of way you feel.
K?
Mm-hm.
Cool.
So  like I said, I start off with  questions of where you were born and where you grew up  in Rochester.
Oh yeah, so  let me- I always ask at the beginning and then sometimes I forget and just do it at the end, but yeah, you're right.
Um, do you consent to doing the interview?
Yes.
Okay  Great.
Thank you for that.
Okay, um,  so, in what part of Rochester were you born?
And  what was your neighborhood you grew up in like?
Are y-  well I was born in-  in nineteen fifty,  and so I-  I grew up I-  my first recollection  was, uh,  growing up on the west side.
I- I don't know.
Do you know the city?
Mm-hm.
Yup.
I- I, um-  my family lived in a house on RD-ADDRESS-2 Street.
Wow.
Mm.
I'm- I live, uh,  in Corn Hill,  so Okay.
that's actually really close to where I'm- Fine.
Okay.
Very Close.
Right.
Yeah.
It's a-  it's a different neighborhood,  um,  now, than it was  when I grew up.
Um,  RD-ADDRESS-1 Street ran all the way through, um- it- it crossed RD-ADDRESS-2  and  like  came into, uh, RD-ADDRESS-3  and came into Corn Hill.
Wasn't called Corn Hill at that time, but,  um,  there was a railroad trestle that-  that  went  through  the neighborhood.
So that's my-  so when I was young, I- I-  I, uh-  I s-  spent time on-  uh, on RD-ADDRESS-1 Street, went to Number RD-SCHOOL-1 School.
And, um,  probably around,  uh, fifth or sixth grade,  my family moved over to the east side.
Um,  w- um,  RD-ADDRESS-1 Street, which is a small street off of RD-ADRESS-2.
And, uh,  we  lived there until I started  high school,  and, uh,  we moved to  RD-ADDRESS-2 Street,  and, uh,  you know,  then I went to RD-SCHOOL-1 High.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wait,  no.
Nathaniel-  Nathaniel was, uh-  isn't that-  RD-SCHOOL-1 School is on  RD-ADDRESS-2  RD-ADDRESS-2 Way, used to be RD-ADDRESS-2.
Okay.
Cool.
And you?
That's an interesting story.
I mean that's- Oh, I'd love to hear it.
Yeah, right.
That's what I say all the time, and it's like, yeah.
I- I didn't expect- I didn't know what to expect, a baby- baby coming out and-  and I  lost her for a second.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Um,  so I have a question about both of your respective neighborhoods you grew up in.
Um, but w-  first for, um,  I guess, old school Corn Hill before it was Corn Hill, RD-ADDRESS-1 Street, uh, what  brought your parents to that part of the city?
It- yeah.
Well, I, uh-  I, um-  I only in the last  ten or fifteen years-  I always thought that I was born over on the west side.
Um,  um,  there was an apartment-  well I- I guess a housing tract  over on West Main Street now over by King Street,  and before it was  a housing tract,  way way way  back  in the day, there was a hospital on that property.
Um, and I-  it was  genes- um, General Hospital.
And I thought I was born in that hospital because it was like,  so close, and then  fifteen years ago, I-  I, uh-  I asked for a long version of my birth certificate.
And I found out that  I wasn't- I  hadn't been born over there, that I w-  I was  born at the General Hospital over on Portland.
My-  and my parents lived on  Nassau  over on the, um,  north east side.
And, uh,  I don't know.
I really-  I do- I don't know.
I don't know where-  what  led to their moving from Nassau over to, uh-  over to RD-ADDRESS-2 Street.
Um,  but,  yeah,  that's my-  I don't know.
Ten kids.
Wow.
Yeah.
Well, yeah it-  yeah  it was  an-  and-  a-  and  a- a mixture of black and Italian families, uh, in the neighb- in the neighborhood back- back then.
Um,  um,  I- I remember,  you know, know spending time as a- as a  boy,  h- the- there was a-  there was a store  like maybe five houses down  where our house was and,  um,  all the- all they sold  were  chickens.
And I- I remembered,  you know, my brother and I would like,  uh-  would like s- e-  like on s- on weekends we'd  we'd like just hang out.
We'd watch him slaughter chickens.
We'd watch him  pluck 'em and  dress 'em.
Um,  every now and then he would just like snatch a  chicken out of a cage and  slaughter it,  dress it,  cut it up, and  cook it.
And  we would like sit there, and we would eat.
And, uh,  um-  and- and so the-  I d- I don't ever recall-  I don't ever recall  any situations where there were like  any kinds of  racial tensions,  um,  um,  even though the-  the neighborhood was mixed.
Um,  it was b-  it was back at a time when,  um,  you know,  like  gangsters,  mafia  people  like were in the n- were in the neighborhood at that time, and-  a- and still  I d- I don't recall  like-  like  ever  like,  you know,  experiencing any-  any kind of  racial  backlash, uh, of any kind.
We, you know,  u-  though  I- I didn't-  m- most of the  Italian families were older  people,  and I don't remember  playing with-  with  white kids.
I mean, we, you know,  I-  I had  like a  crew of my own I could like  hang out with and,  you know, like-  you know, like my brothers and sisters, we always played together.
And there were other  like  kids in the neighborhood,  but,  yeah,  I don't know.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah,  black businesses,  black-owned businesses.
I, you know- recently I  I- I- I heard the story about, uh, you know,  b-  before,  um,  desegregation,  that there were like  many more black businesses and, uh, b- like, uh, flourishing black  community, business community, and  um,  and-  and now that we've like,  you know, everybody's,  you know, sort of come together,  like  black businesses have really just kind of-  they're-  they've gone away.
They've disappeared.
But it-  but yeah.
I r-  you know,  I had-  had some relatives, um,  there's a  healthcare center on  Hudson.
Doctor RD-NAME-2,  yeah.
He lived right down the street from us.
Thanks.
Thanks for that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
Um,  I just wanted to build on that.
So you think that maybe integration sort of had something to do with the    redistrubi-  re-  redistribution of people I guess into  different neighborhoods?
Because now Corn Hill is mostly white,  and I think in general, um,  you don't have as many  mixed areas of  Rochester Yeah.
in the city, Yeah.
so, Well- yeah.
well, I mean,  uh, you know- I mean,  what's now called  Corn Hill was like-  in- in my opinion, was basically stolen from the black community.
Right, and- and,  you know, they-  they bought properties on the cheap, and then they- and then they,  you know,  rehabbed 'em or  rebuilt  and, you know, and made it this-  you know, this  great  bastion of like rich white people.
And, um,  yeah, I d- so I- I- I- I, uh-  I don't-  I don't know if  integration-  you- you asked if integration is the cause of it, or  or i- is- is the reason why  neighborhoods are- or communities are  isolated.
Is that wha-  is that what you're asking, Well, the- that they've changed, right, from the time or- that you grew up in it to what it looks like now.
What kind of- what things have been happening such that- Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I- you know I- I-  I think  that someone-  someone apparently back  in the sixties was somewhat  forward  looking  to the degree that they were able to  map out  like a neighborhood that  would be close to the center of the city,  and-  you know, and- you know like an easy walk or an easy bike ride,  you know, to  downtown  work, and,  you know, businesses, and-  and government offices, and they bought up a bunch of property.
And,  y- you know, it- I don't know at what point- I thought it was-  it was more  seventies, eighties, nineties when people from the suburbs were coming back into the city.
But  yeah, uh, that's about the time Corn Hill  like sprung up too.
So,  you know,  you know, people were coming back into the city, and they were like scoping out neighborhoods that would  be convenient to their office locations.
So,  yeah.
Okay.
Makes sense.
Okay, so nineteenth ward, um,  do you think, uh, the neighborhood has changed much since you,  uh, growing up as a small child, and in- in what ways?
Mm.
Yes.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
So  pretty consistent I guess you would say during the span of your life thus far.
Okay.
But my-  my perspective would be a little different.
I'd-  you know, I think  the-  the neighborhood that we live in has pretty much  stayed the same.
The neighborhood has stayed the same.
My recollection of  like  RD-ADDRESS-2 Road when we f- when we first moved in and- and had children,  RD-ADDRESS-2 Road was a pretty vibrant  business community,  and it's not the same anymore.
Like-  like  anchor businesses are no longer there.
The- the other reason why  w-  like RD-NAME-3 and I  chose to  buy in the nineteenth ward,  right, you know,  one, we-  uh, we-  we had-  we bought-  we got a really good deal on the house that we- that we bought.
And the other- the other thing in it- it- it- it- it goes back to what RD-NAME-1 was saying about the-  the community association.
The community association  w- was formed by  y-  you know,  like  some people who ha-  who had s-  some  pretty revolutionary ideas.
I mean  the- the nineteenth w-  d-  and- and they were mostly white people  who  were,  um,  beating up or, uh, you know, working hard to beat up on banks who were like redlining like a- like all over the neighborhood, and- and- and that's where the urban by choice, that-  I mean it-  you know I- I- I hear what you're saying, but that's really where urban by- you know, we live here because we wanna be here.
That kind of sentiment came from is- is that they,  um,  th- you know, they wanted to- they wanted the  neighborhood to be,  um,  inte- integrated, and like, you know, like, lots of different people living.
And that was-  that was their  aim,  and- and,  you know, helping nor- the, um,  neighborhood  become  more vibrant.
And-  um,  and,  you know, I- I was active in the nineteenth ward community association for some time,  you know,  not-  not-  n-  not a great deal of time, but-  and I- and I know that there was- there was always- there's always been a great push  to bring,  um,  you know, a  diversity  of people into the association, but it was just,  y- you know,  you know, efforts to-  to make that happen  t- you know,  just never-  it  never came to the point where we-  where we were hoping that it would come.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Um,  let's see, what else was I gon-  oh, I wanted to ask about  what you thought about U of R's sort of role in-  in  trying to create this, um,  college town for students, and how you think it might be affecting  the neighborhood.
Yeah.
Totally fine.
Yeah.
Yeah, no.
I went to the U of R, so I- I- I know,  like I can totally relate.
It was for me as a native, I was like  w- Yeah, like yeah.
And you would have kids walking midnight, two AM in the morning around pla- Plymouth, yeah.
Mm-hm.
But  y-  you-  you know that  well, there- there was circumstance.
There- a- a few f- circumstances Like they ad- a- th- this i-  n-  Jewish  community  came to Boulder and offered them- they- they liked the building.
I mean,  before the-  I'm- I'm-  before Boulder was there it used to be a drug store on the corner of Brooks and Genesee.
Drug store moved out,  and, uh- and the building was- for years.
I mean, the roof had caved in.
It was like- it was a freaking mess.
And- and nobody, nobody was interested in that- in that space.
City comes along.
The nineteenth ward also had a hand in it.
Um,  they-  they bought the building or the building was given to 'em by the city.
They rehabbed the building.
They, you know- they had fundraisers and blah blah blah.
Really  an absolute  beautiful building.
I mean, once they got it all done, it was a re- it- I mean,  you could sit up-  downstairs or you could go upstairs.
It was a great building.
Now all of a sudden this Jewish  community, this rabbi,  all of a sudden, he's interested in the building, and it has to be that building,  right.
He can't-  he can't go across the street where Boulder is now.
It has to be this building.
And he went to that guy who own- who was running it,  who had gotten a special deal  from the city,  and offered him money, and the guy said no.
Like he, uh, initially  he said no.
And- and- and my understanding was that he-  he had entered into a d-  a deal with the city that obligated him to stay in that building for a certain amount of time.
And-  and-  and-  but the Jewish community  kept hitting him.
Y- you know, they-  they kept coming back.
And they-  they- they- I ge- I guess eventually hit him  at a time when he was really vulnerable, like cash flow was not really all that good.
And he, uh,  he made a deal.
He made a deal with the city, and, you know-  and he s- and he sold the b- and he ended up selling the building.
But  y- I-  the- really, that was a- that was a beautiful space.
That was really  h- h- you know people enjoyed- I en- you know, I enjoyed going to th-  and- and really  w- what,  you know- and then eventually, he's out of business in the- in  the space that he was in, and  ended up being sold to a- another party.
And it's not n- nearly as- I mean, it's not- it was never as warm as  the original building.
But- Right.
Right.
And- and really, I mean, w- you know,  y-  I- I liked  the coffee house  but a c-  coffee house, I- I don't see that being a-  you know, like a-  a black attraction.
I mean, I- I-  I- I like it, but I think  like everything else in that neighborhood, in that- in- in that  area right there,  that was u- that w- that really all was set up  not for the community.
It was set up for the U of R.
It's set up for the U of R  students and their families.
The hotel, that was all set up for the students and their families, right.
And- and-  a- I always wondered.
I- I- you know, I- it's like-  like- ugh  cause my-  I- I have this  vision of a U-  like-  like-  U of R students  moms and dads, I- it-  the vision that I have is that they're not-  they're not- these are not poor people.
They're- that they're- that-  that,  um-  that the-  the U of R f-  families are high end people.
They're, you know-  and I just wondered  like- like, how the hell is that gonna work?
Right?
Because-  cause literally, I- you know,  y- y-  y-  you c- you can cross the street or y- even go a block  down the street, and you're like in a totally different neighborhood.
You're like-  like-  like this thing that this  utopia that they were trying to build there on that-  on those four corners.
I just didn't see how it was ever gonna work.
And it was just- it was-  it- it seemed to me- and I- and I- I had  some of the same  worries that you had.
Is a- is like, you know,  i-  i- it's a haven for m- muggings.
I mean it's just- it's just a-  y- you know,  l- you know, like these people are gonna be walking down the street, a- and they're gonna d- you know,  you know, somebody's- somebody's gonna get hurt,  right.
Th- the-  I- I think the utopia experiment that they tried,  y- you know, and they- they got those buildings on Plymouth and then I think they they did some-  some more  building  deeper into- into- into that neighborhood.
I think that experiment  led to College Town,  right.
Because they- I just-  it- it just didn't- you know, they realized, you know, what- what the hell?
I mean, this is- this is not-  this not working out the way that-  I mean that whole-  that building where the coffee shop is now, that whole-  that was supposed to be like U of R office space.
Never happened.
Never happened.
I mean, the second floor- the d- the- the first floor was supposed to be like  restaurants and  coffee shop, and, you know a- or, you know,  you know, places.
But they could never attract like,  you know, Applebee's, or, you know, like-  like these solid franchises  to like, come into the- they-  th- th- you know,  they could never attract 'em.
And so you ended up with-  y-  you ended up with like,  y- you know, Subway, you know, tried it.
Um, California Rollin  tried it  and didn't succeed.
Th- you know  I mean, they just couldn't attract.
And that's why-  that's why they-  that's why the- I think that's why they built College Town is because  that's a safer,  safer, safer neighborhood for  U of R families.
And in spite of that,  it-  it doesn't seem to be working.
I was just gonna say that.
I feel like, uh, I think two or three of the things that were in there already closed.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yup.
And I'm just like, Yup.
this is not serving-  I mean it's bad enough that you're just trying to serve  the U of R community,  but it's not even serving them.
Right.
Right.
Right.
But it- see-  but it's i-  in- in my- i- in my opinion,  they- they didn't set up-  they didn't set it up in a way where it's-  cause-  cause really  I drive down that way, and- and often, the- it's like, you know,  damn, I'd like to try that,  but where am I parking?
Right, y- there's no place for you to go.
I mean, I can't-  I can't just pull over and park on the street.
I'm- and I don't- I don't know  if there's a parking lot  back behind those buildings or not.
I never tried.
You know,  it's just- it just c- it just-  I- you know, it was r- you know,  seemed like a good idea to somebody, but they didn't- I don't know that- well, from my  observation,  they didn't plan it out.
I mean they didn't  like go to the next level.
Well, you know, how- Alright,  so you got these really cool shops and stores  and bakeries up in here,  but how are you gonna- how are you gonna  get people to stop.
I mean I- you know, it just- it just- I don't get it.
I mean,  I don't get i- you know.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
No.
So  now if someone wanted to go to an event  such as the ones like you described, where could  they expect to go see those sort of shows?
Yes.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Okay, and I guess, a more related question, but I think I kind of know the answer, is  just  w-  what are there things t- what things are there to do, period.
Right?
Like what are the different scenes or activities  people engage in here?
What does Rochester  have to offer that's  for entertainment purposes I guess?
Yeah, downtown.
Okay.
Well I- I was thinking  a- I mean just in terms of like entertainment  like the-  the-  the sports teams that are here, like the  soccer teams and the hockey teams.
Um,  um,  in the summer, like you were saying, that i- that number of festivals that are-  that happen in the- in the summer here,  um,  you know,  every now and then, like a  big name  act  comes to town.
Um,  but  yeah,  really I mean there's-  there-  not a great deal  to-  to do.
I- I-  you know, the-  the pace is  slower here than it is in  New York.
There-  I don't know what it's like in California, but,  um,  i-  it's,  you know,  it's- it's a little slower  here.
And it- I was-  when I was listening to you talking about,  you know,  coffee houses that used to do  like things that,  you know-  that  you liked and that  they  went away.
I- it just seems- it just seems that  like businesses are  changing.
I mean,  you know, Java Joe's did it  for a while,  and now they don't.
I mean things-  things are changing.
I- you know, you know, I just-  you know, I- I'd like to think that if you build it, people will come, but that's not always true.
Right.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
No, not-  but yeah, because, uh, and I- and I-  by and large  n-  black people are not  soccer fans.
I mean- I went to that.
Yes.
a free-  yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I- I was seventeen or eighteen when that concert came out and I just remembered l- Yeah, but- thinking like,  why is this concert like so small?
The crowd was-  I don't e-  like  a- yeah.
I don't even know what  kind of number I could put at it, but it was small in comparison to  how large that stadium was, yeah.
Yeah.
Well, can you call what you do dancing?
Yeah.
And- and, you know, I mean,    um,  uh, we-  we have a-  you know, like a river that goes through the city.
We ha- we have a-  a l-  a l-  lake  a- and, you know- and,  you know, there are-  there are things  that are attractive, like, you know, like-  like you were saying,  Mendon.
E-  There are  things that  you-  you can do, but  you gotta have  mobility.
Y- y- I'm- you know, I mean y- y- you can take the bus, but I mean even i-  even when I  didn't have a  car,  the thought of  like, well, yeah, maybe I'll go to the lake.
But then  at the same time, I'm thinking, yeah, but to get there I gotta do downtown.
I gotta get another bus.
I gotta, you know- I gotta lug a-  you know, a  bag of crap.
You know,  I mean, it's,  um-  but at the same time, when-  when  we were kids,  y-  you know, I-  I lived over on the-  on the east side  over by Central Park.
We would walk.
We walked.
We-  we walked everywhere.
Uh, you know, we walked to Seneca Park Zoo.
That- I mean, that's a hike.
Right.
Were- but we-  we did it.
W- you know,  we weren't-  we weren't held back by,  you know,  um,  you know,  like the  energy that you had to put out in order to,  you know- to get to where you wanted to go.
But it's-  it's different now.
I mean,  y- you know, I-  our grandson, I mean, he-  like he comes over and he spends time with us at least once  a week,  i- i- um,  but- but his focus is like-  like  digital.
Mm-hm.
Right.
And-  and,  y- you know, I mean,  you know, we do stuff.
We- we- we have board games.
He likes playing Monopoly,  right.
And we do that with him,  but the-  the imagination  o-  of  children is really not sparked like it used to be like when,  you know, I didn't have a box in front of me that I could play with.
Maybe I- you know, if I had,  maybe I would've done it.
But i-  I had to use my imagination, like, you know, cause I didn't- you know, I didn't come from a-  a family that had like a lot of money, and so,  you know, we were shooting each other with sticks and, you know,  y- you know, we-  we-  you know, what little TV that we did see,  cause I d- I think  I-  there was like only  two or three s- local stations.
You didn't have,  you know, like a thousand stations like d- like they do now.
Y- you know, w- y- you know, we'd-  we  took what we saw on TV and used our imagination and  play.
And,  you know,  w-  I don't think we  do a lot of that  anymore.
Yeah.
Yeah He does spend a lot of- he does spend a lot of time outside.
I mean, even- even when he-  I mean,  cause he makes friends pretty easy even here.
I mean,  he connects with people.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, my-  my-  my sisters call me  bougie  cause  w- you know,  we-  we do stuff, and, you know,   as much as they call me bougie, they're also bougie.
The- they- we come from a really bougie fam- you know.
We are.
Um,  cruising.
Right.
Vaca- you know,  I mean,  when I was- when I was  young, I mean,  l- l- l-  probably the farthest I ever went with my mom and dad, cause they didn't have a car.
They didn't have a car.
We depended on  like aunts and uncles.
The farthest we ever went probably as a family was to Letchworth State Park for a picnic,  you know.
A- you know,  and  a- that was exciting.
I mean, that was really pretty-  that was pretty cool.
It-  you know,  and I- and,  you know, like now  if-  if I wanna- if I wanna go to Toronto, I can go to Toronto.
If I- if I wanna go to New York, I go to N- you know.
I-  like there's-  there's really very  little that  like holds me  back,  right.
Yeah.
School president actually.
Student body, you know.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
I mean there are times,  y- you know, I-  I almost have to pinch myself because I'm  like the-  I'm in a position,    y- you know- I'm in a position  that-  that  you know, mostly  held by  you know, social workers and  college-  you know, college people.
And- and it-  it's- you know, there are times I,  you know,  like I-  I say to myself, like, you know, like,   yo, what the-  what the fuck?
I mean,  what am I doing?
I- you know, like, what am I doing here?
And I- you know I- recently, I heard,  you know, somebody-  there was a  treatment program out in RD-WORK-1 County,  and the-  the woman who was running it was like a-  she just had a-  she- I- I say she just had a-  a-  a bachelor's degree.
And, uh,  somebody on the t- on my team was saying,  well, how do you get to manage-  how do you get to manage an- a- an outpatient clinic  with just a  bachelor's degree?
And I'm like sitting there   because I had managed that same program without a degree.
Like, Mm.
you know,  like fourteen years ago.
I- you know, I- you know, it's like  well, you know, the- the answer to that question is  i- y-  you know, you-  you know your shit, you t- you know, you-  you n- you know, you know what you're doing.
Um,  but  it- you know, it- it's- is- th- they're really-  and I- and, you know, RD-WORK-1 County is not-  I mean, a lot of black people in RD-WORK-1 County,  but they're-  you know- they're not in  positions.
They're not- they're-  they're not in positions.
They're,  you know-  i- it's really-  it's really very-  it's sad,  you know.
But  i- RD-WORK-1 County is also not  a big industrial kind of a  community either.
It's mostly service work.
So-  but  yeah,  thanks.
Thanks.
How'd you get into the profession?
I, uh-  when I, uh-  when I was going to RD-SCHOOL-1 High,  I was- I, uh-  I graduated in nineteen seventy and,  um,  in my junior year,  you know,  the-  the black community was kicking RD-WORK-2's ass, right.
The- right, they-  because RD-WORK-2, i-  you know, didn't have  black people  working for 'em.
And so  RD-WORK-2 hired  a-  this black human resource  guy,  manager.
And he was  going around to the high schools  cause b- and se-  back  in nineteen seventy,  RD-SCHOOL-1 High was changing.
It was like-  i- it was,  you know-  it was-  it was becoming more  b- of a bl-  you know,  m- way more black people were in RD-SCHOOL-1 High School.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And j- and so-  so they sent this guy, this recruiter out to  talk with  students.
And I- I was interested in-  I liked science.
And so,  um,  they sent this recruiter,  and I talked with him,  and he said, well when you graduate, you know, give me a call.
And so I- I called him.
So this is like a really long story.
But- so I- so I called him, and- and, uh,  and I got hired.
I got hired   with a high school diploma  in RD-WORK-2's research division.
I was like-  I was running exper-   you- it's like, what the fu-  You know,  okay, okay.
So-  so I got hired at- at- at RD-WORK-2.
I was working in the research division.
And I, uh-  I quit  after five years because I, um-    I, you know-  I quit because I didn't-  I didn't like  the feeling of working for like this huge company  that didn't  care, didn't give a sh- a shit about their people.
I- I just felt like  I was like a cog.
And so I quit, and I-  I had been working part time  for a local ambulance company,  and when I g- I quit,  um,  I-  I went to work for them full time.
I-  I was, uh,  an EMT  and, uh,  um, I worked for them for like maybe three years, and, um, I-  I left and I- I ha- I-  there was another black guy who had b- who had worked  for the ambulance company  as well.
And I just happened to run into him.
Um,  um, in seventy-six, g-  New York State changed their  public intoxication laws.
Um,  it was no longer,  um,  a-  the state would no longer allow police to arrest people for being publicly intox.
Um,  and so e- e- um,  this g- this-  this guy that I knew  was working, had gotten a job.
Um,  the state  said that every county had to have  a sobering up center.
Like that's where d-  i-  if someone was drunk on the street,  that's where they had to go.
And so I went to work for them.
Um,  and I stayed there for five years, and then  RD-WORK-10 had a, um-    an outpatient  substance abuse program.
And I had had interact- interactions with the,  um,  the director of that program  and, uh,  he was looking for a counselor and he came to me.
A-  um,  he was familiar with  like some of the work I was doing, and he came to me and asked  if I wanted to  work for him.
And so I-  I went to work  for him, and I stayed  with him for five years.
And then I went to  the state had an  inpatient program here at RD-WORK-2 Clinic.
And I-  I went there and I stayed there for  three or four years, and then I got recruited by another-  I got a- I got recruited  by an-  another agency, RD-WORK-2 Corporation,  and I stayed there for twelve.
And, uh,  i- i-  in the years, I- I had-  I'd had-  earned enough  educational hours that I could sit for  the state certification.
I got my c-  my certification, and then,  um,  after twelve years I left  RD-WORK-2.
And I  I got a job  in RD-WORK-1 County,  um,  as a manager of the  outpatient program out there.
And then  I, um-  as I was working in that capacity,  my  boss  a- w- became aware that  RD-WORK-1 County was st-  talking about starting up a drug court.
And he told me to force myself in on the meetings to get in there,  and so I w- I,  you know-  I- I was able to like wiggle my way into the meetings.
And I,  you know-  I m-  I must have impressed s-  people on th- on  that  planning  team,  um,  because when they were looking to hire  a  coordinator for the court, they came to me and asked me if I wanted a job, and I-  I said, well w- y-  well what does it pay?
And they told me, and I said, no.
I won't-  I won't take the job for that.
And-  and, uh,  so they hired somebody else.
She was there for only a short period of time.
She got snatched by Rochester's drug court.
And then they-  they came back at me,  and they had-  they had petitioned the state f-  to incre- you know,  to  increase the grade level.
And they came at me, and they said,  well what about now?
And I- I said, well what does it pay?
And they told me, and I said, okay yeah.
I'll- I'll do that.
And  so I've been there for fourteen years.
That's great.
Okay, so  let me turn to you for a second and ask about, um, your profession,  and, uh,  also y- a-  why you- I wanted to ask a little bit- go back to the college experience, why you chose, uh, RD-SCHOOL-2.
My mom used to work there for a period of time.
Yeah, she might know her.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
Well,  okay, I have  like, uh, my last question- it's been so great talking to you both.
It's really been enlightening in different ways.
Um,  so I always ask about language at the end, and whether or not you, um,  feel like Rochesterians have an accent  or have been told once you left, you know, Rochester, hey you sound  x kind of way or,  you know, this kind of way.
So yeah,  uh, do you think Rochesterians, um, have a r-  an- have an accent, whether or not you can perceive it  is another story but do other people tell you maybe?
Yeah, I don't know about you, but I-  I've been told by a number of people that I  have  the Rochester accent.
It's, uh-  it's more New England  like we-  New York,  n- n- not-  but yeah,  um, and my relatives  in New Jersey who also have accents  tell me  that I  talk-  that I,  you know-  they can hear it-  that they can hear it.
I don't know about you.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right>  Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
Well,  m- this concludes my questions, but, um,  do you both still consent to me using these interviews?
I always aks at the end.
Okay.
Yes.
Yup.
Great.
And I just have a couple, uh, background questionnaires, um,  and then yeah.
We're done.
I can pay you.
