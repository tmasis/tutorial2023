I believe so.
Yes.
Okay.
Right.
Was born, first off on the Lower East Side, in  RD-ADDRESS-3 well,  I- I- I e- I ended up moving there, RD-ADDRESS-6.
Uh.
I was born.
Clinton Street, that's um.
The intersection of Clinton and Madison.
And I was born  uh,  January twenty sixth, nineteen fifty-eight.
Um.
And I grew up p- pretty much right after I was born in Bellevue Hospital.
On the East Side.
I went right into LaGuardia Housing Projects.
Uh, and that's where pretty much, things started there.
Okay.
Let's see.
Okay.
My father was originally form New York.
New Yorker, all the way.
My mother also a New Yorker, but her parents were from Georgia, from the South.
And they resided, originally, in Harlem.
And  I guess they thought things would be better on the Lower East Side and decided to move  on the Lower East Side around the time  uh,  shortly before I was born actually.
And so, that's pretty much how we ended up down here.
Um They were- no.
They were from New York.
They were.
Yeah.
They were from New York.
Yeah.
Exactly.
G- m- m- before that, I couldn't tell you.
But I know his parents were from New York.
Yeah, it was.
Yeah, and I think they figured maybe it would be a different thing, and also, I guess if you- At that time, if you applied for the housing projects and stuff,  you- pretty much when you-  you  got the application you were approved, you  had to go wherever they kind of put you, I guess.
And at that time, their perm- probably weren't many  housing  developments  then anyway.
Cause I lived- I lived in one of the older ones, so.
Yeah, exactly.
A lot of 'em were on the Lower East Side, and at that time, I guess that was the only thing available.
And that's where we ended up.
Uh.
School.
School.
I remembered school because  you know, at that time, I guess they thought I was a fairly intelligent kid.
Cause I was in a special program and stuff like that.
Um.
Uh.
My brothers and sisters.
Originally, RD-SCHOOL-2-  um, um w- w-  What was that?
What was-  Well, you got me now.
Um.
RD-SCHOOL-5.
RD-SCHOOL-7 that's what it was.
RD-SCHOOL-8.
Then from there,  I was transferred to a school, which at that time, seemed like it was a real far distance from my-  from the original  you know, it was like across the street, you know, from  from my- a- where I lived.
And they transferred fo-  transferred us out of there  in to  another school.
You know, was like especially set up for kids who were like a little more intelligent than the average kid.
Yeah.
Gifted kid.
That's what they called us then.
IGC.
Intellectually gifted children or whatever.
So, anyway,  that was you know, they transferred us there, that was RD-SCHOOL-4.
Now, that school, even though then, it seemed like a far distance, like you know, you're a little kid in your third grade.
It's like, I'm going to another school now?
And it seemed like it was like, in another country or but, it was like right  down the block  It wasn't really that far.
We took a short bus ride.
And we got to get bus passes.
That was cool.
You know.
And we got to get on the bus together.
A few of us from the same development went to that school, so.
That- we went there  for elementary school.
Uh.
Early elementary school.
Then, from there, I think I went to junior high school.
RD-SCHOOL-2 is Junior High School Fifty-six.
That was a- Also, that was across the street from my house.
Yeah.
That was really close, that was like you could fall out of bed and and be there.
Yeah, that w-  e- when you're late.
Cause I was always late.
Uh.
Then from there,  RD-SCHOOL-5.
Which was is like right f-  right around the corner from well now they call it something different I don't know what they call it now.
It's not RD-SCHOOL-5 now.
No, it's Grand Street right there.
Right here.
Yeah.
It's right here, and it wasn't- I don't know what it's called now.
I think it's called something different now.
But, that's where I went for high school.
No, actually, I started out in RD-SCHOOL-2.
I started out in RD-SCHOOL-2.
Man, Ya- Okay.
Yeah.
I don't exactly remember.
RD-SCHOOL-6.
I don't know if they're still around now, I really don't know.
And what they teach.
Yeah, it's not there?
Huh?
Yeah.
They-  They probably did.
That's probably what happened.
I went there for a short time, and then I realized there's no girls in this school, so.
Yeah.
It was an all boys school.
I don't even know if they have that now.
Yeah.
So, I went there for like,  I ha- not even a semester.
Six months or so.
Realizes, ah, this is not cool.
I don't even know why I went there.
I think I went there wi- my brother went there.
He had graduated from there and um.
So, I kind of went there because he was  the- said it was a cool school, but  you know, he left out the part about there's no girls in that school.
So I s- I ha- spent six months there, and then I got into RD-SCHOOL-5, where I stayed and graduated   in nineteen seventy-seven, I think it was.
Uh.
Uh.
Oh.
I'm dating us again, Kara.
Uh-oh.
I messed up.
Um.
After high school, I think I stayed out a semester, and I ended up going to a community college.
RD-SCHOOL-10 where I majored in accounting originally, and then I got into music, and changed my major to music, and.
Uh.
Studied music there.
Music theory.
Um.
Everything, pretty much, Bach Harmonies, and stuff like that.
Um.
The whole- yeah, history, jazz, stuff, you had everything in there pretty much.
It's a mixture of stuff.
Um.
Actually, I didn't graduate from there, but I- I  pretty much went  you know.
I went there for two years and didn't graduate and ended up uh  after all along, I was working in the supermarket as a  you know, clerk, and then they made me the manager, not a manager, made me assistant manager there.
RD-WORK-1 Supermarket.
And- RD-WORK-1 at that time were big-  big, uh, uh chain of supermarkets back then.
I was working at the one in the village on  RD-ADDRESS-2 Yeah RD-ADDRESS-2 and like around RD-ADDRESS-3  I worked a f- in a few different ones, but I ended up on-  on the  RD-ADDRESS-4  uh, store.
Uh.
Where they made me assistant manager there.
And so, you know, it was- it got  you know, kind of  busy there.
I- I won't say that's why I-  I didn't finish  uh, uh  graduate from-  from college, but   you know, i-  they were paying me enough money where I could feel- I- you know, I don't have to go to school, you know, whatever.
Which was a mistake.
Anyway.
Um.
Did that for a while.
Um.
End up  moving into Brooklyn,  left the neighborhood for a while, but not too far.
Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, right over the bridge.
In um Yeah?
Yeah.
Lived there for like three years, I actually had a roommate who was RD-NAME-2 RD-NAME-2, we'd be roommates there.
And we lived there for like three years.
I forget the exact three years we were there.
Yeah, we were early twenties, then.
Like, we- we kind of moved out  early  twenties.
Yeah, moved out of there.
And moved into the- a loft we had- we had in, um, Brooklyn.
Storefront loft, which was really nice at the time.
Um.
Where we had a little rehearsal studio there, and we did all our musical stuff, and had our equipment and pianos and stuff had a lot of fun there.
His band rehearsed there.
Then after that,  let me see, I'm losing there .
I should know more now, but after that, I think we- we decided we didn't want to renew our lease.
He was gonna get married.
Oh.
Not married, I don't think he got married, at the time, or he was gonna have a kid.
Oh it was a lot of things going on there.
And I was with a woman at the time, and w- decided oh, we- you know, we're just gonna go  you know, our separate- not separate ways, but w- you know, we're not gonna have this place anymore.
And we did that.
I moved where ever I moved, which was I think up in, uh,   uh  around Lincoln Center area.
I think he stay- he s- Yeah.
Back into Manhattan.
He stayed here on the Lower East Side  uh, and  got married, and  had kids I think.
Uh.
Or kid.
At that time.
Um.
I had a little baby girl also around that time.
I think I was about twenty-six at the time.
When we had a little girl and- and just started, you know.
This whole family thing.
Still in Manhattan.
You know, for a  I lived in Manhattan most- I just recently  actually moved to the Bronx.
I did, actually.
A- For- for a short  while.
My mother was still living here on the Lower East Side.
She lived there- Yeah.
She still lived there.
And she had retired   and then she became ill and  passed away.
And so, we moved back  in, in the hopes of we could get that apartment.
You know we could kind of regain that apartment.
My bro- my older brother was still living there at the time.
And he um,  he was on the lease.
You know, if you ha- it's a special  thing.
You have to be on the lease, if you.
Yeah.
Yeah, but if you're not on the lease, then you can't.
So, he was on the lease.
And none of us el-  none- no w- I weren't I wasn't.
So.
What ended up happening, he died.
With uh, without me ever getting on the lease.
And so, I had to leave that apartment where I grew up actually, again.
You know.
And.
Yeah, nah, it was so- yeah it was okay.
I- I- maybe it was time to get out of the neighborhood anyway at that time.
Um.
I was back in around two thousand and one, I think.
Yeah.
I think  I left  uh.
I was living in Harlem at the time, I ended up moving in Harlem  like a block away from where my father grew up.
You know.
For a while there.
Yeah, yeah.
Manhattan, though.
I've always like Manhattan you know.
Not like anything.
Now, I'm in the Bronx.
Yeah, way f- It's just far away.
You know.
It's just distant and you don't have some of the amenities that you have here in the city.
So you know.
Yeah, I- ha - my home, most of the time.
There's nothing you don't  not a time for tra- unless I'm doing something like this.
You know, don't get out and start traveling around, you know.
Very long time.
Take me a hour and a half maybe to get here.
Um.
Okay.
Yeah.
Alright.
I mean, that's clo- yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You never know on the weekends.
You don't know- never know what the train is gonna be like.
And  for that reason, you know,  I stay home most of the time.
Okay.
Well, most of the friends.
Most of the friends  lived in the building or in that  you know  complex or whatever you wanna call it.
In that project  development, uh  most of the- most of us, you know, you-  you play with whoever lived there.
Basically.
Um.
Well it back- I don't know.
Then- then, it w- there would've- there were not a lots of  there were Jews in the area maybe, but not in that development.
No, there were Jews in that development.
There weren't uh-  they weren't in abundance.
And there was a mixture, you know, it was all kind of- it was you know.
Few Chinese, you had- you had little Spanish, you had  Italian, you had a little bit of everything back then.
Um.
I guess black was a majority in there, in the- in- in that development.
I- I- I like, I don't even say that  then  not back way- when- I'm talking about when I was three or four.
And stuff.
I don't- I don't  know if that was-  there was any majority.
It might have been a balance.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And everybody kind of, we played- everybody played together.
You know, and there was.
Oh, we played  tag, that was the- no.
No.
No.
What was that thing we played?
Where we'd run around  it wasn't tag.
Yeah.
Manhunt.
Right.
Manhunt.
Right.
Yeah, oh, I mean, i-  we didn't really play in the playground that much.
Yeah, we'd just run around the whole development.
You know, and we'd play- that's the name of the game, manhunt.
Right.
I don't even remember that.
Yeah, and you just.
And I forgot exactly how the rules of that game.
How did that go?
Yeah, and you just kind of I think it was a group of people  you know, it was a group- you get a  couple of groups together, and they just like hunt each other down, and try to find- chase each other down.
And  No.
We just tagged you I think, and that made you part of our team or something like that.
How did that go?
Yeah, I forget how that went.
And then, you'd hunt down to the last guy, and then I forgot what happened.
We'd probably do it all over again.
You know.
Kick the can.
We played that.
I played that.Kick the can.
Kick the can, you just got in the middle of the street, and you get a group of people on one side, and another group of people on the other side, and then put the can in the middle.
It's a silly game if you think about it.
You kick the can Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
I forget exactly.
Yeah.
You kick the can, and then somebody had to chase it.
What was the thing?
I think you forget that.
I know we played it and that was a big game back then.
It was a group on one side and.
Yeah.
And a can in the middle and it would run- who could kick the can first.
Then you kicked the c Yeah.
And somebody would have to kick i- I forget how exactly that went man.
It was a silly game.
So, I don't get the poi- No- I don't either.
You know, when you're a kid, it is no point to a lot of games.
You know, you just do stuff, you know?
There's no point to it really.
Checkers.
Slu- uh.
We played skellzies though.
We plays skellzies.
No, no, no, no.
These were like let's say can you know, let's say you get bottle tops.
Yeah.
And you fill it with clay.
You know, y- y- you k- you know, I- you modify your top though.
You know, you- so you have, you know your top floats across the ground really good.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Exactly.
You slide it on the floor, and you scrape it til it's smooth so it goes across the floor really quick.
And it's accurate, and you- you know, it helps the accuracy on it.
You know.
Or if you were really good,  and your father used the shaving cream, right.
There was a special top that they used to have on the shaving cream.
If you had one of those tops, then- and you pulled one of those out, we knew we would be in trouble because  those tops just were made  for skellzies.
You know.
Yeah.
Exactly.
And you put some you know, you- you'd have to go from box to box.
This game I remember now.
You'd have to go, you'd start in box one,  box two was like diagonally across this thing that we'd draw out of chalk.
Maybe  not ten feet.
But about seven feet.
The next box Yeah.
You had- you had to draw this thing on the ground.
You know, this whole thing.
And, so you drew it out on the ground, and you ha- you know, we didn't actually measure it, but.
But.
And then you'd sh- you'd shoot your checker from box one to box two, and then you went to three,  then you went to four, and you went all the way to thirteen.
And if you got through all that, and you were the last guy standing, you were the winner.
You know, that kind of thing.
Yeah.
You could knock hi- you could knock him out of the box.
If he's near the box, you could knock him out of the box and what would happen is  if, um.
I- what was another rule there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You'd have to go out.
You'd have to really go- I wanna think- it was like- I forget.
Yeah.
Sort of like that.
And you had to start like not even on the block.
You would had to like two blocks away, you had to shoot your checker.
Until you got  with the rest of the guys.
It wasn't really all that, but.
It was something like that.
And that was a game I remember we did a lot of.
Um.
Yeah.
And Yeah, well you- you d- un- in- as long as you were back by six o'clock.
Before the  before it got dark.
You could explore whatever you want.
But, if you weren't back by six o'clock, then you'd there would be a problem with your next day's  explorations, you know what I'm saying .
Yeah.
Exactly.
Pretty much.
No.
Pretty much you kind of did what you d- I was responsible.
So, you know, I- you know, I guess other kids who you know, did crazy things, you know, people you know, had to be monitored a little bit more.
But, I was pretty responsible, so.
I didn't think.
Yeah.
Pretty much stayed in the neighborhood.
You know, younger, stayed in the neighborhood, and then  you know, girls got involved, and you would go visit girls, that was- you'd go in other neighborhoods and you know.
You would have to see l- it's only like project developments, you'd go from like the LaGuardia  houses to the  uh  what was that uh  what's the thing behind No.
No.
Yeah.
Well, they were in a whole nother thing, but what's the- Vladecks Houses You know.
And i- and it was territorial back then a little bit.
You know.
And everybody knew you were from LaGuardia, you're not from, you know, you're not from the Vladeck, so.
It was some little territorial thing.
No.
It was all the same thing.
Pretty much all the same thing.
But you had different groups of people, who recognized that we're Vladecks, and you're the  thing and you know, as you walked into their project development, you know, people would take notice, you know.
Yeah tha- and.
Sort of.
A little bit.
A little bit.
They got into that later on.
You know, I don't remember exactly when that started, but  it got into a little thing like that.
I'm from The Hill, you know, you're from  the, you know whatever project.
And we're talking about we're not even a mile away, but there was these territorial things going on back then.
Uh.
Which made it more interesting when you went into all the neighborhoods, you know.
When you we- so.
That- you know.
I mean.
With some people.
I mean, not with me.
I never really got into that, but.
I know- I remember there were like people who would go.
My brother told me stories of him going to visit girls in the Smith projects and got into the fights with the guys from the Smith, because  you were going to see one of the girls from the Smith, and you're from LaGuardia.
Yeah, I've heard stories that  I've- that never happened to me, but with him.
No, no, no No, well no, I liked- I- I could fight.
I could fight.
But, I didn't fight.
You know.
I could- I boxed and stuff.
Did some- we did- you know, I studied karate for a while.
Yeah.
Right, right.
Little gangster.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I mean I saw it, but I never got involved with that.
Never- never involved myself with gangs and  things like that.
Yeah.
I saw.
Definitely.
Definitely.
Definitely, you could see that.
S- this might have been junior high school time, so we were Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We were in junior high school.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Well, yeah.
We didn't do that.
I was then, you know, ki- school.
Kind of concentrating on school a little bit.
Finding our little part time jobs.
To get little things that we wanted.
And.
Girls, you know, obviously.
Um.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, yeah.
That's okay, if you can't you know, leave out that ingredient.
Yeah, exactly.
You had to go to Vladecks, or wherever they were, that's where you had to go.
We didn't have any in our neighborhood, you know, we already used those up already.
So, we had to go to other ones.
But,  that, basically, and  k-  and then, I think we moved out in around Seventy  eight, somewhere, Seventy-nine, I think we left there.
Somewhere.
Yeah.
Exactly.
And then, I actually, d- we didn't come- I didn't come back for a long time after that.
Um.
Oh, it was totally different then.
Yeah, it was totally totally different.
Like, I mean.
I did- First off, I didn't know anybody who lived in the building.
Didn't know anybody.
Exce- there was still few holders  you know, hangers on that-  that still were there from when I grew up.
That were still- the few people still there, lived in the neighborhood.
But, basically,   The.
There were a lot more Chinese people that stay in there because  I think they, you know, there was an expansion of Chinatown, I felt, you know, at that time.
Cause ex-  Chinatown was like- it was like a  borderline there.
Nobody came past the bridge there, you know, it looked seemed.
But, then there was this whole expansion thing of Chinatown, so where a lot Chinese people in the building.
There were a lot of, you know, it was more Hispanic and Black, basically dominated that- that building.
And then, I didn't know anybody.
You know, I didn't- I didn't know anybody, except some of the holders on that were still there.
So, I didn't really, you know,  you know, you kind of kept to yourself then, it wasn't that same  camaraderie that you had back  you know, when we were when I first, you know, when I grew up there.
Not that same thing, everybody kind of kept to themselves.
It's more closed, you know, mind your business.
You know, that kind of of thing, it was  more like that.
When I came back.
Yes.
Two Thousand and One.
Yeah.
Well, that also began to happen not at- i- you know, you could see that like, some of like,  the-  the village  and- an-  and- and the yuppie crowd, or whatever you want to call what's- was coming down to that area too as well, you know, which brought up the rent You know, prices of rents and stuff like that.
So, and that kind of got pe- push other people out of the neighborhood.
Like I say, the holders on were still there, you know, that kind of a thing.
No, but I think even some- even some of the public housing, they were sold off, even  too.
Yeah.
Some of that was going on.
I think that's still happening now as a matter of fact.
So they  you know, they- they're s- kind of I think what's happening is they're- they're  looking f- they nee-  you know,  real estate is- is- is- is  you know, is- is  at an all time high now.
They're looking yeah.
So, they kind of you know, le- places to live now, you know, and so, now, if y- I think  pretty soon, if you don't have any money, you won't be living on the Lower East Side anymore.
You know, pretty much, they're gonna filter all the you know, those  Exactly.
But, you could see, that's what's happening, you know.
And- I- you- you're gonna have to be Yeah, you could see that pretty soon, you have to be of a certain income to live down here.
I think that's happening.
Slowly, but surely, that's happening.
Um.
Except for those people that hang on, they ain't getting out of here, I ain't leaving.
Um, I'm gonna be here, you know, and there's a few of those people that I still see today, right now.
that I'm say, oh man, it's good to see you, I haven't seen you, you know, you're still here, you know, still living down here.
Uh.
I have a nephew that lives like  Delancey Street.
Um.
That's about it.
Yeah.
That's about it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No doubt.
No doubt.
I w- I mean w- I just did that show, we just did that show and it was called the Lower East Side  Band Reunion.
Cause back then, uh, also that's what we did.
That's what I left out.
Left out that little part.
Where you said, what do we do?
you know, what we- we got into music then, how did I- could I leave that out?
Yeah.
That's a very important part.
And, that's what we did in the early seventies as well, you know, we formed bands and stuff, and you would see different bands in the neighborhood.
You know.
Lot of mus-  culture and stuff, as far as musically.
You know.
Which you don't see now either.
Um.
Say that again.
What's that question?
Oh, I played uh, saxophone and I sang, I played- dabbled with the piano a little bit then.
Um.
Form- we formed a band.
You know.
I don't remember, we had a f- few different names for the band back then, and um.
So, we did that.
Yeah, yeah.
Um.
So, we did that.
That occupied a lot of our time, we did shows and  we played together in bands for- me and RD-NAME-2 for a while.
Uh.
Yeah, we're working part time, I was going to school, at the same time, playing in these bands, wherever it, you know.
And we played wherever, you know, we'd just pull our equipment out and start playing in the street, you know, we didn't care.
Yeah, we just, you know.
Yeah, I'm kind of doing that now still.
Still doing that.
Um.
I got like a little recording studio that I own and operate in the Bronx.
Um.
So,  still doing that music thing.
Yeah, yeah, a little-  Yeah.
A little bit different.
Little bit different, but Yeah, I'd play in the subway sometime.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do that.
No, that's all I do.
That's pretty much all I do.
Um.
Yeah, it's okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's good.
Okay.
Oh, I- W- uh.
Okay, now it may have changed  since the you know.
But let's say.
Then, the Lower East Side, when I was a kid was like to right here,  to that bridge here, which is the Manhattan Bridge.
Mighta went to Houston Street.
The- now, uh, and over to the East River, actually.
It kind- those were the boundaries to me, then.
Now, they've, obviously, they've expanded.
Uh.
Yeah, I thinks- yeah.
That i-  to-  to go even further than the bridge, let's say.
Up to as far as  Fourteenth, to- or even Twenty-Third Street.
And, Yeah.
I think it go- i- wa- they call it all Chelsea.
They got all kind of names for it.
But I d- still the Lower East Side.
Yeah.
East.
Yeah.
Exactly, East Village, but that's the Lower East Side to me, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's- it's still the s-  you know, it's kind of like  overlapping and stuff, so.
You got that going there.
Mkay.
Okay.
Well, I mean  there's certain social things that you're-  that you  communicate  on, certain things that you do together, to- to-  You're raising your kids, your schools, you got your daycare, you got your- your-  your- whatever you- activities, after school activities that kids do, and the-  the job kind of situation, I- I don't know how many people, you know, work in- on the Lower East Side.
Um.
Yeah.
I mean, it's a poppy lot of people that work here, you know, and there were like, back also, in- in- in the days, they had like  the Henry Street Settlement where a-  s- kids would go to do things after school programs they had.
And that's all a part of, you know, what the community should be.
Which they don't have a lot of those things now.
The Edgies, the Educational Alliance.
Which has been around forever, I think they still there.
And  lot of people  you know, a lot of activities they have going on there.
Uh.
I mean, I don't even know, I couldn't even tell you, I couldn't tell you be more specific about it, but I'm sure that they're doing things like that there.
And Henry Street Settlement, I think, as far as I know, is still around.
Uh.
Um.
That's all.
Yeah, I mean, people work and people relate and socialize and stuff, like that.
Yeah.
That whole interaction thing going a- I mean it's lesser than it was.
Back in- Back- it's a little different.
Yeah.
It's changed.
It's not the same.
Uh.
As it was.
I think we were closer  back then.
You know.
We were closer.
I don't know why that is actually.
I don't know what, well, you know, the reasoning,  you know, reason why you know, that separation thing came around, but.
I c- I c- I can't exactly say.
Um.
Put my finger on as to why  that might have-  may have changed.
It's just  you know, if  when people move out of the neighborhood, you didn't teach their kids  that- the same things that we  l- l- learned, or the same values that we had, I don't know.
I just know that it's not that.
Uh.
No, I- I- n-  No, I- I- I- k- I k- Oh, no.
You definitely don't have any of that.
There's not even like  The programs that they have and stuff, it's- it's- it's- it's  just a lot of- lot of things are not there that-  that  would bring people together.
You know what I', saying, a lot of- Well, I mean you- you- if you listen to the news, you can hear how much money we're spending on some bullshit.
Where that money is not filtered down into the- into the community  and I think it should be.
A lot of that government money is not somehow, doesn't find its way back here.
Um.
Which, you know,  government funding for certain of  these programs and these places,  if it's not there, then these places will close up, and then that means there's not gonna be that social gathering, that's not gonna happen anymore.
So, that's probably The- some of th- Yeah.
The reasoning.
You know, there's just that people don't have a way to.
Where do we gather now?
There is no place to gather.
You know.
It's- it's over a long period of time and still happening now, you know.
And Oh, when I growing up early on,  like I say, I studied fencing at the Henry Street Settlement.
Yeah, I s- took fencing up there.
Uh.
They had.
Yeah.
With the whole thing.
I had to- I was pretty good actually too.
Um.
They don't have that  now.
You know.
And you'd go there, and you'd meet  guys from you know, wherever.
All those different project people, you would see people  from each  development would wind up there at these-  at these, they-  they taught k- had karate classes down there.
And you'd meet guys from everywhere, you know?
You'd  meet guys from the Smith, any- everybody would end up there.
So, you had that camaraderie, and that kind of, you know,  Then, if those programs don't exist, and then you don't have that  you know, that meeting of the minds kind of a thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's nothing to do now.
You know.
Where do we go?
You know, what are we gonna do?
So, I think a largely  a- a lot of  the money being spent is not being-  doesn't find its way back to these communities.
And- and that's  the reason why a lot of-  there's not that same  social thing going on.
Yeah.
There was that.
I mean, I didn't see that, really.
I mean it was there but, you know, it  it just seemed like it was  it was just part of it.
You know.
And it didn't really.
Yeah.
It didn't really you know, and I didn't involve myself in it, so it didn't really You know.
But you did see it, ye- it was definitely a you know, you'd seen a lot of drugs,  uh,  in the neighborhood  that kind of filtered in.
I don't think that when we were growing up early,  you didn't see that so much, or- or maybe we just didn't see it in,  you know, didn't recognize it.
As you got to be a teenager, and then you saw more of that, or maybe just realized what was going on.
And so, it's a lot of drugs filtering into the neighborhood.
Um.
I mean, I knew people that- that- that  involved themselves.
I mean, I'd still know some people that's still the same people.
Are still-  uh.
Yeah.
Couple of people from back then, when we were growing up.
Yeah.
And they would still, they're still doing it.
Same thing.
Um.
So,  you know, y- you seen a lot of that.
And you kind of ignored that, because, you know, that's not the good stuff, so you, kind of, you know.
Kind of  didn't wanna pay attention to that, but.
But it existed.
It existed.
It's definitely.
Yeah.
I mean, you- you could not ignore it totally.
It depends to what level do I get involved with it, you know what I'm saying.
And and usually, you know, you just went about your business, you know, just kind of like, whatever.
Um.
Yeah.
That- I think that was- I don't think that was eighties.
That may have started later in the nineties.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But, Yeah, an- and- and basically, what happened, and you get this new element of people coming in.
So now, there's really nobody to talk to, you know, the people you did know are not there.
So, that whole social community thing is  becoming less and less.
You know.
You got.
I would say the middle class.
I think back then, we were like lower cla- we definitely were lower class, we weren't like middle class then.
Definitely weren't that.
We were like  upper lower.
You know, they had these- these- they had these  they had all these these des- yeah exactly It was lower.
We were in the lower.
Whe- we were the lower lower, or the middle lower, or the upper lower.
We were in the lower.
Yeah, yeah.
exactly.
Yeah.
Something like that.
And then, you have an influx of, let's say, middle class.
Which, like you know, the whole middle class, it's a whole nother thing, you know.
We don't know what that is.
So, the influx of that.
Obviously, it's gonna knock that whole  community spirit thing down, because it's- it's  you know I'm-  They're like people coming from Mars, you know.
These uh, you know.
They're not part of us, you know.
I mean it's good.
Only thing I don't like is the fact that the rents seem to go up when that happens.
You know.
And then you get to people who can't afford to live there anymore, then they're pushed out.
And  You know, again, that whole community thing is gone.
You know.
And that's what happens when those things happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I think if you live- if she was in the projects, no.
No, no way.
Right.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Actually.
Yeah.
Right.
Right, right.
Right.
Right.
Well, that would've been.
Right, right, right.
A- Of living in the projects.
Oh, no doubt.
No doubt.
Right.
And that's- that's what I'm saying.
That's what's happening.
Whe- when you have that.
Uh.
It does kill that family thing.
Because you can't afford now to live here, and everybody's gonna get  you know, wherever you g- whatever you do, you're gonna have to do whatever you can do.
You know.
And so, you- it won't be that solidarity thing going on anymore.
Um.
With the family thing.
So, that kind of breaks up the family.
That would do that  as well.
Um.
I'm not bitter about that.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm you know.
Tha- just- just.
Well, the neighborhood got better I think at one time, cause there was the whole just drug influx at one time when, you know, that whole Lower East Side, Avenue A, Avenue B, Avenue C, it was like  crazy drug infested there.
You know, you go down there, you see buildings burnt out, all kind of stuff.
And that whole  gentrification thing  kind of helped that.
You know, the neighborhood now is, I can't live there, but, you know.
I still can't live there.
But the is.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah.
I can't afford to live there, but it's good to see that the neighborhood, they're fixing up the neighborhood and stuff.
So, you know, there are positives and negatives to that Yeah, yeah.
Hm.
Are these good?
Hm.
Um.
Henry Street Settlement.
One of 'em.
Um.
Cause I- I- I-  we used to rehearse as a band there.
We rehearsed there.
I studied karate there,  studied fencing there.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, yeah.
Was into that.
I'm- r- you know.
Not now.
I don't do anything now, but.
So, that's a point and place for me.
Um.
Basically,  I mean, in- some of the  surrounding parks in the area.
Cause we always found a way to play in these parks  you know, we'd get the band together, and we'd just play whatever park.
We'd set up our equipment and we'd find some electricity, a lamp pole to plug into, plug all the amps in, and we'd just play.
Yeah, we'd just play.
Oh, we played all kind of, we played rock music at one point, we played uh,  R and B music, uh, pop  music, I guess, and back then, it wasn't all these classifications of music too, it was just music then, you know.
Now, they have you know, all kind of categories now, but.
Um.
R and B music kind of.
Yeah.
Play some funk.
We  call it funk.
We- I still don't like to get into those classifications, but.
That's what they say it is.
And that's Yeah, yeah.
I, you know.
I just call it music, you know I let you put the title on it, you know, I don't.
But,  basically, that Henry Street Settlement was a big  big part of my life growing up because  it, you know, s- that's where the, lot of the development stages of my life, you know took place.
Pre- I l- I think I did, I did, I did.
I f- I cause I studied- I was in the basketball team that was a part of the Henry Street Settlement.
I couldn't play, but.
I sucked really.
But, I think I got on the basketball team cause my brother could play.
And they put me on the team thinking that, if i- you know, if you're his brother, then you should be able to play.
I couldn't play at all, but you know, they found that out pretty quick.
But, everything else I did, they, you know, was fencing, and the karate, yeah Most of the time.
I think I got in, I'll tell you a quick story.
But,  you know,  I- it was another guy who sit on the bench with me.
And we would have these things, or who's gonna get in first?
You know, it's like,  I bet I'm gonna get in first, and he said, nah, bet I'm gonna get in first.
So, one day,  I was so excited, a guy p- okay Mitchell, you getting in.
And I got so excited, I got in, you know.
And they gave me the ball.
And I went the other way.
And shot the ball in the other people's basket and made it.
You know, that was like.
That's when I knew that basketball's not my   my thing.
Yeah.
Go-  back on the bench.
That was it, and I was like okay.
My brother was like, he was like, oh, no.
He didn't do that.
Did he do that?
Exac-  Yeah, I got- I end up playing for the other team.
But.
Uh.
No.
Basketball wasn't my thing there, but.
Everything else.
And that Henry Street Settlement's where all that happened.
So, I'd say that was a pretty  big part of my life back then, yeah.
For me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Manhunt.
Kick the can, ring .
Red Rover.
Right, I think we played one of the organ- one of the organizations, that um.
A- in fact, the Henry Street Settlement.
Yeah.
Well, we did so many things for them.
Every event.
A proposal right?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Did you really mean that?
Yeah, well, do you need all that?
And he's like do you need all that?
Back then it was too much.
What do you want?
Get a couple of tambourines or something?
I think we did get a PA system right?
We got a PA system out of it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, you know.
Wait'll you see how much a guitar costs now.
Right, right, right.
Yeah.
That was, uh.
RD-NAME-4 right?
Lotta things happened down there.
What?
Now?
Yeah a decent one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, and that's f- that's- it happened at Henry Street Settlement.
Only thing that went on there.
So, that was an important part of us- our thing right?
Then we played for every function they had.
Every function that site, so they had to.
Exactly.
Or they o- forget- I think that was the worst thing that we shoulda- that we shoulda did.
Because now, we were at their- at their will now, you know.
They're gonna snatch that.
Yeah.
Exactly, you know.
Whatever they-  Whatever event they came up with.
When they came back from camp  And I don't even know what day that was, you know.
And  we had to play for that.
But, I think we enjoyed it so much, we did it anyway.
But.
That's pretty much what hap- Henry Street Settlement was a big part of our thing.
Yeah.
I see a lot of that.
I mean they all look nice, but I would love to be able to afford to  live in them, but I- I can't, so.
I mean, I'm- I'm happy to see that.
Again, but that  involves, you know, people that can afford that, eventually, it's gonna overtake all- it's gonna wipe everybody out eventually.
Um.
So, those people that can't afford to live in those  types of housing developments  um.
will be  you know, pushed out of the neighborhood.
And eventually, it's- it's we- it's not even gonna be like the well, not gonna be the Lower East Side that I knew.
I knew.
You know, it's not gonna be that.
Uh.
They'll be people living here, and it will be just a boundary now, it'll be just a name.
It won't be, it won't have that same  feeling, you know.
Of- of  people together, that togetherness.
It won't have that.
Doesn't have that now, so.
And that's what's gonna happen.
Basically.
Mkay.
South of Delancey Street.
Wha- Now, what's the cross street then?
Okay.
I think, alright, alright.
I think I know where that is.
Yeah.
Because it's a Rite Aid right down the block.
Alright.
Okay.
Mm.
Mm.
Well.
I'd like to see some  low income housing there.
And- and-  and some more  like community center type thing going on there.
I think we don't have enough of that.
I think it's yeah.
Mm.
Yeah, like to see some of that go in there.
A place where kids could go.
Kids got no where to go now.
They got no where to go.
And I- I- I mean, I honestly me- I don't know everything now, cause, like I say, I don't live here anymore, but.
They got no where to go.
Kids got nothing to do.
We played in the street, we did all kind of things.
Um.
I don't know what the hell they're doing right now.
Some of them.
I know my ki- i- my- my- well, my kids are old, so.
But,  unless you-  I got- let's say, my parents-  they didn't-  we weren't as close as I am with my kids now.
Put it that way.
Or my kids when I- when the- when they were growing up.
It was a little different.
Parents were parents, kids were kids.
You stayed in your place.
It was none of that.
But,  because of that wasn't- that, you know, we didn't have that  bond  that maybe I have with my kids now.
There were still other things for us to do.
I bond with- th- I- with my  kids growing up, we  play together.
You know, we did things together.
So  I didn't do that, growing up.
you know we didn't, you know, like I said, they went to work, you went to school, and  you did what we told you, and that was it, so.
Well, our- our alternative, would be now to go to these places.
You know what I'm saying?
So, we had that.
So, without that now, what are the kids gonna do?
If- if I- I- like I say, I'm not saying I'm an exception, But, I'm close with my kids, you know what I'm saying?
And we- we create things to do  and stuff like that.
So, if without that, Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My- my.
No, well, my- my-  they both live in the Bronx, they all- they're all in the Bronx, you know.
Well, they lived in Manhattan too.
Then they ha- you know, they couldn't afford to live here, so that's where they could afford to live, and that's where they live now.
So,  you could see that whole thing happening, but.
Um.
Yeah, something for the k- you can get people together.
You know, what I'm saying.
And- and- and have things for them to do.
Cause I don't know what the kids are doing now.
And- and- and- and I  that's- I think that  you know, doesn't help  the crime situation, because when you don't got nothing to do,  you tend to do  silly things, you know.
You got nothing to do and you got nobody teaching you what you should be doing.
If you're not close with your parents, and you got no where to go, you're just gonna be running around  doing crazy stuff.
Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Pretty much, so.
Yeah.
You could say, I mean, it's a lot of homeless people too, you know, it's a lot of.
I mean, I'm- There's a lot of that going on.
And I think there's a lot of money out here,  if we can afford to give sev- e- seven hundred mill- billion dollars to these things,  give a billion to l-  in- to- for these communities to do something.
You know what I'm saying?
It wouldn't take that much to do that.
You know, but obviously, there's no money in that, so they don't do that.
You know what I'm saying, so.
And that's why that's not happening.
But, I think that should happen.
At some point, somebody should stop and say, hey, what about the common guy, the regular guy?
You know, who's money we're taking in taxes every week.
You know what I'm saying?
Well you know.
Did we forget about him?
No, never really.
No.
I mean.
I n- doesn't matter to me.
No.
Nah, that doesn't bother me.
No.
That doesn't bother me at all.
I mean, I'm ev- I mean, if you go  I was down in Georgia not too long ago,  and you don't see any tall buildings down there.
You know, that would Then you would see a giant building like that, and wou- that would maybe  you know, stick out like a sore thumb, but.
And here, I'm used to.
Wherever you go, you see tall buildings, so that wouldn't it's not an issue for me.
At all.
I would think you sh- a requirement would be before you moved here, you should read a book that would explain the whole thing.
And the importance of what happened here early on.
Yeah.
Exactly, exactly.
Exactly.
And I think cause people, you just moving here, I'm just moving here I- just cause I'm so I can be close to where I work in Midtown.
And that's the only reason you m- you live here.
And maybe I got a good deal on an apartment, or something like that, and you know.
I think  i- i- that  and that wouldn't just hold true for the Lower East Side.
That should hold true for-  for any neighborhood.
You know.
You know.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Exactly.
You know.
And, but there's definitely a lot of history here on the Lower East Side, obviously.
Right.
Right.
Exactly.
And I think that was one of the reasons why they mo-  why they moved here.
Because you know, they lived in the Harlem, which was not that far away.
Still in Manhattan.
Where you figured this would be a whole nother thing.
A nicer place for the kids to grow up, you know.
And that kind of thing that could, you know.
See another side of what's happening, you know.
That's probably was one of, some of their  reasoning as to why we should  you know,  move here.
And.
I don't know.
I.
I don't look at it like that now.
You know what I'm saying?
It doesn't- it doesn't  ha- you know doesn't look like it has that same effect.
You know, it doesn't look like that's what you come here for.
Is you come here, Lower East Side because it's close to Midtown and I work there.
You know what I'm saying, or.
I mean, you see businesses starting up, you see little things going on.
Um.
But, it's a lot of housing things go-  built  you know,  that- that was down here.
You don't see businesses down here.
Obviously, it's just  but people reside here.
And,  l- most of the housing being built here is not for the people that  kind of, you know, started living here.
way back then, so.
Um.
It's not the same.
You know, it's- it's just not the same.
