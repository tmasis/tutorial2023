Where were your parents born?
And what did your parents do?

And  so, let me ask you this.
Thinking about-  Well, let me start-  let me go back.
So tell me a little bit about your neighborhood, what-  the neighborhood that you most connect with when you were little, and it may be two or three different ones.
So tell me kind of about growing up, maybe your house, kind of the street you lived on.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
So,  were you- okay, so you were the youngest of four.
How- tell me about your siblings.
Right.
Do you think-  Okay so when you talk about growing up really fast, what do you think  that-  what do you- what do you mean by that?
Like what-  how did that cause you to be different from like someone who's like- So when you were six, versus when your friends were six.
Wow.
And your  brothers and sisters talk this way too?
Tell me about school then.
When you were in elementary school, did you- did you do well?
Did you like school?
Was it too easy for you?
So- okay, so this is- so you're growing up in the eighties, right?
So technology is not-  when you talk about technology,  what was your reality of technology when you were young?
So were your friends- Okay thinking about your like-  Did you have a lot of kids in your neighborhood?
Did y'all play together?
Uh,  yeah this ain't nobody else.
So- okay, so you were in this area, you were in Northeast.
So your parents- so did you drive to like, Northwest or did you drive to like, Potomac?
Like where'd your parents take you to go play with your friends?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay so at- did you ever like school then?
Did you ever en- So tell me about high school.
I can see that.
So what- okay, so you started at RD-SCHOOL-3.
So how'd you get- Okay, from RD-SCHOOL-3- Was RD-SCHOOL-3 because your parents wanted you to be exposed, or did y'all move over to that area?
Why'd you start there and then end up RD-SCHOOL-3?
Mm-hm.
Oh, p- ah, I was thinking- Mm.
Mm.
I was wrong.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Wrong- Wrong RD-SCHOOL-3, wrong RD-SCHOOL-3.

Mm-hm.
Wrong county.
Mm-hm.

Mm.
How did you- okay so how'd you end up- um,  so how- so, how'd you  transition from co- like,  from s-  from high school to college to military?
And so when you moved- when you went to the military you got to travel a lot, clearly.
Um, were y- so you were separated from your daughter.
Oh, okay.
Wow.
And people- you know, you will never go out of business cause people always die.
Yup cause people always will have babies.
That's why I'm in the mortuary.
What's your craziest HR story  that you can share?
Right.
Okay, well we're not that.
We won't- we won't be that, so you're good.
You're good.
Mm.
That you just had yesterday?
Wow.
That's-  well, okay.
So how do you-  you-  So you still have your own business now?
So what's your business?
If you don't mind me asking.
You said we, so it's you- Oh wow.
That's amazing.
And so I remember the other day we were talking just kind of in passing.
You said that one of the things that you had to leave DC.
And it took- no, when you came back it took you a long time to appreciate it.
Tell me about that.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Oh congratulations.
Aw, happy mommy.
Mm.
So you're never a tourist in your own backyard?
Or you haven't been?
Mm.
Sounds like you almost hit somebody, sounds like you almost hit somebody.
Are you still-  so do you still live in- you live in Waldorf, now?
Does mommy still live here?
In- in the District?
Okay.
Oh, she's right- she- so right over the line.
So y- whole family- She's on two ten so she's down some.
Gotcha.
Gotcha.
So let me ask you this, so this is just a random question cause you've done a lot of things, you've experienced a lot of things.
Was there ever a time you felt like, oh my god this is it, I'm gonna die?
You never felt that way?
You never felt like you were in danger  of you losing your life?
Hm.
Cause you like to fight.
I mean, but you will fight.
Like,  so your job, it's like you're an artist.
Like,  I mean, but  a miracle-  I guess I just don't understand that wor- Wow.
So you dealt with the families of nine eleven?
Like- Wow.
Y- so, clearly I'm not the one, I would not last in that environment.
Clearly I'm not th- that's not a job for me.
Um, so let me-  let me  ask about something else.
So do you consider yourself a DC girl?
Like,  even before you left and you didn't- Do you consider yourself like,  DC girl?
Like, love DC culture, a DC girl.
Did you go to- did you listen to go go music?
What's your favorite- did you have a favorite band?
Backyard.
North- Northeast?
Oh you said Groovers, you said Groovers.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
Okay, I'm sor- I'm'a look- you know what, I'm gonna go back to my desk, I'm'a look 'em up.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
I'm not a go go connis- Did you go to go gos?
She stopped?
You were getting in trouble?
Wow.
Did you- did you- you repped your neighborhood?
Oh.
Cause you had a lot of neighborhoods.
Right.
Mm.
What- um,  what- um,  did you eat mumbo sauce?
Oh, currently.
Where do you get your mumbo sauce from?
Okay, mm.
I'm sorry that you had to experience that traumatic experience.
DC doesn't claim Baltimore?
What you mean?
Why not?
I know.
Um,  let me talk about- So, even here, right, this neighborhood where you've grown up  we see condos across the street.
Shrimp Boat is not Shrimp Boat, it's Shrimp Boat  Center, or whatever it's called.
Let's talk about gentrification.
I think so.
Tell me about going to the Boys and Girls Club when you were younger.
Mm.
And didn't even know it.
Hm.
But go back to this idea of feeling safe, because that's so funny.
L- like you felt safer in the city?
Like, Cause the s- the statistics will tell you otherwise.
Every- every article, every report, every census bureau, the piece information you pull is  very much  saying something different.
Mm.
Mm.
But even if you've seen the city changing, right, that area- So, where you've grown up, I mean, it's happening.
It's happening.
The developers are moving.
So that area's changing very quickly.
So you still wouldn't- you wouldn't  purchase there?
Mm.
that makes sense.
Do you think it's a class issue or a race issue?
Why?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
And that's why you had conversations about the stock market.
