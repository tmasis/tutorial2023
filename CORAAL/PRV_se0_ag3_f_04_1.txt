Mm-hm.
Well,  we have a eight o'clock service at our church at Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church, on the corner of Howard and uh,  Beasley.
And then after the service, we went on into Sunday School.
And around  ten thirty, maybe something eleven,  we left and went to  Saint Luke  Baptist Church on Fire Tower Road for a service.
Mm-hm.
Our pastor preached out there.
And the choir sung and the ushers was there too.
And- Uh-huh.
After the service we commune out there, and after communion,  they serve lunch.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Well  when I left there my sister  told me she was fixing  dinner for us after we went back there and stayed with them when I got home.
I reckon it was about four o'clock when I got home.
And I was tired.
Mm-hm.
Cause it's Saturday morning.
Minister RD-NAME-1, one of our   uh, late mother  daughter is a preacher.
She is, uh, legally blind but she preaches.
And uh, she had a service out to the rest home at  uh, ten  thirty,  and I didn't sleep at all  Thursday night but I put it down  Friday night.
And I woke up  Saturday morning nine thirty,  so  all I could do to get up and get dressed, take my medicine  and uh,  eat and go out there.
Then one of my friends  I been knowing ever since she was a child is member of Saint Luke  Church we went to yesterday and we, uh, after that service,  every first and third th- th-  Saturday,  Minister RD-NAME-1 have a service at her  house at one  thirty teaching the Bible.
And so  we went-  when we left the rest home,  we went in the mall, looked around.
And then I went by, uh,  McDonald's and got me a sandwich and a soda.
And by that time, we were walking- walk back to our cars, it was time to go to the  meeting at the minister's house.
So when we did leave there,  after that service, we went in the other mall.
Um,    down by Walmart out there where.
And then she wanted to go back somewhere else but we were tired.
So I came home and she went home.
Not all the time cause this arthritis and- and sugar  give me trouble so but when I feel like it, I go.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I was going to my sister.
She was going out with me then.
Yeah that was Saturday.
Mm-hm.
Hm?
We went  back in the mall.
I had bought me a dress,  and we went back out and got it.
Mm-hm, but I didn't wear it yesterday.

They used to only deal with Southerner but then  when he died, I think his brother took it over.
And then s- s- a- he retired and somebody else took it over.
And then she wo-  l- well the last one, she worked  for,  she worked for Mr.

And she worked for they s- their son and his wife.
And then some Brant and Sylvia Nash.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
That's where I was born at.
Over there.
Yes, I- I remember uh,  w- when the flood  would come.
Uh,  we used to stay over there usually at  until it- it would get  about to the house down in the door .
And we would be over there.
Sometime we would  play in the water.
And then when they say it was gonna get real high, uh, we- they would- we would go over town, and some of the peoples I can't think of the name now,   they would let us go in their house and stay.
And  some-  it- sometime it'd be two or three families.
And we would make patterns on the floor  until the water go down and then we would come back home.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm, but  it would be down Main Street but then come over there too.
Mm-hm.
It- I-  I know one time  uh, some said they had went out on a boat, but we would go out before it got that high.
But the highest I remember was  Floyd.
Ninety nine.
I- I was um,  here, and my sister stay on a other street.
She hadn't been uh, got here from Seattle, Washington.
Cause I was here  then by myself  and uh, I stayed sickly  so she said she was gonna come home  so she would be close to me.
And  that day,  I-  I w-  uh-  it had  faired off.
And the water was  down there, and the water,  I went to go around there to my neighbor's, going on to Walston, um, before you got to Beasley Street, and I knew- known that corner that water was just coming.
Anywhere you go, I could see water.
But I came home that night.
It being so fair, I just know the water was going down.
And I went to sleep.
And my neighbor woke me up  and told me, say, you know that  uh,  my nephew call me and say he was gonna get his mama,  and he was coming by at us,  Said that-  Said the dam gonna bust.
That water is coming.
And I turned all of the way around.
And I called  my cousin, and she said  she didn't know nothing about it.
Say cause they had then called and see what the water was gonna do.
And my aunt  was in there, she couldn't walk.
She was sick.
And  so I called some neighbors up  in the apartment  are no good.
Cause they didn't drive.
And one say she was waiting on her son.
The other one said she was waiting on her daughter.
And so my sister didn't have a car then and she said, what we gonna do?
I said y'all just come on through the school yard and come over here.
And  they did- She and her s- youngest son  and we got it-  I had a truck then.
And  she drove and had to drive through water  before we hit Church Street.
And when we got out Church Street going in-  uh, Church Street to Main Street.
I could see that water just swirling by,  back of my cousin house.
We had to go through water then.
And  so she says, where we going?
I said over town,  cause I know it was high over there.
And we-  and we were going on  and so all the cars  lined up.
Cause one thing I would like to go on and out, we couldn't get no news.
And  so all the cargo, we kept on over there by the post office.
And I said, now we gonna go  to a telephone booth  and call some more folks and that's what we did.
And we didn't ever see them cars come from over in Princeville,  so we just started to go- come back.
And we went there and stopped by the bridge, you know,  cross over from the bridge and park.
And they was sanding the  dyke so the-  tryna keep the water from coming over.
And we stood  and I didn't have on no  coat or nothing.
I  trembling.
So one policeman told never take me to the town hall.
And we went down there, and I was surprised- you know where that  uh,  town hall is now?
Well back there was that project?
And tho- the water was back there, those people had gone.
Uh-huh cause some of 'em was down to the town hall, the old town hall.
Well we went down there.
We stayed down there, and her son, he was young.
He stayed down there to try to help bag.
And after awhile, somebody come in there,  said, we can't do nothing for that dam.
It gonna bust.
And my sister said, let's go.
And somebody said, well wait til the mayor come.
And she came right on in behind 'em and she told us to go to her church.
That was over East Tarboro.
Or somewhere else she told us to go but anyway,  we went to h- we took one boy-  two  over that river.
Uh they stood on the back of the truck.
And when we  got over there to her church,  we could see the water  coming up from the low end of Church Street,  coming on up.
RD-NAME-2 say, we can't stay here.
She turned that truck around.
And we went to the mall.
But  we went back out.
But  uh,  they was- it- it was just opening the high school  to let people in,  and one of 'em  out then.
So we left and went to Martin Middle Junior School and they let us in there.
Mm-hm.
And uh,  plane- it was a helicopter or something was coming in there with them folks,  and I said RD-NAME-2- cause we hadn't got no cots then, we was sitting up on the seat.
And um,  I said RD-NAME-2 I can't sleep here.
I said I'm going to the truck.
So me and her went in the truck.
And we set up that night.
But then the next day, they brought in cots Mm-mm.
No, everybody was sitting up.
No- I think some folks had something to sleep on.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I can't think exactly but we stayed there  until  you know, they put up uh,  some trailers over  Rocky Mount?
FEMA trailers.
And  at that time, they just had  the on- I think one bedroom cause that's what-  but we had to come over to the uh, high school  and they processed us and got us straight and sent us over there.
And you know what trailer you were going to, but I tell you, when I went to that trailer,  it- it- it was nice  cause you had your own private place.
You didn't have to hear a lot of noise-  Cause those children keep  fuss.
And- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Cause some folk, I reckon they walk  m- about all night and all- but anyway  I think everything went good.
It- cause  n- uh-  they was bringing in folks from down Greenville way.
Some of everywhere.
It was something going on.
And I was so glad to get back home.
Mm-hm.
I can't think how m-  h- how long I was there?
I sure can't.
Mm-hm.
It was quieter in your little trailer  than it was, you know,  in the school  because it was so much noise.
Mm-hm.
What?
After the trailer?
Oh I stayed in that trailer until they got this house  uh,  about ready.
Mm-hm.
The Baptist people worked on it for me.
Mm-hm.
Yeah -  yeah, the-  uh-huh.
Cause they-  they had to take  e- all these walls and things and floors out.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Y- well, they were going around trying to help everybody  and they did good.
Cause I said, Lord, just let me get home.
If I just  can sleep on the floor.
And a lady  I had worked  for,  one of her friends at Albemarle,  she was a hundred and  three, this lady.
I worked  for Miss RD-NAME-1  and everybody   thought Miss RD-NAME-1 was mean,  but she was good- she was a good lady  to me.
Cause she was active.
She wanted to go walk and I would walk her and  um-    She want to go s-  to the um, Christmas Parade to see the horses, and  the- her-  the one was looking out for her  uh, said her money was getting scarce.
And they had cut my hours to one or two.
But anyway, she wanted to go to that parade, and I knew it was cold.
And so I asked the head nurse, you know, where it was over there?
Would it be alright?
She said, yeah, just wrap her up good.
And that's what I did.
And I had come home but I went back to take her and she was so happy.
Well she didn't live  another year before she died.
And I was right there with her.
And I didn't get to finish school  and I went  to Edgecombe.
It was community college then, and got my GED.
And I go back there and she would ask me about it cause she-  she was a principal.
She was a smart lady.
She was a hundred and three, but she kept her good senses un- until one weekend she fell and hit her head.
And I went back there, but she was still was good but  not as good as she was.
Mm-hm.
Miss RD-NAME-5.
Mm-hm.
Not here.
Um,  in uh,  r-  uh, in the Raleigh area.
Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.
After she got down,  she  came- went to the Albemarle here.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
No, it's not over in Princeville.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And um,    they took her back, had a  funeral  in uh,  Raleigh.
And so  one of my sisters in church,  and she was  uh, my beautician then.
She took me  and another lady up there  to the funeral.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I was old myself.
Mm-hm.
I went out there to get my GED.
I reckon I was about sixty five or seventy when I went out there.
Cause I was the oldest one in my class.
And after I passed that  and they said, well if you do this kind of work- that's what was rumored you would have that uh- I had gotten my uh,  nurse's aid.
They say we gonna need nurse's aid one.
And I went over Rocky Mount  and I passed that course.
I believe that was um,  eight week or ten week one.
I went nights over there.
And  after um,  I worked until my mother  uh, got down so she couldn't work.
I was working for another good lady.
I worked for her til about  two o'clock in the day.
And I went home one day.
I would always go by mother cause she- she worked up  until she got-  she was in her eighties when she died and she had worked in her eighties.
And I went by there and she was a-standing over the stove, and I said, whatchu doing?
And she said, I'm tryna cook me something to eat.
I said, you haven't ate?
And she said, no.
And I had to tell that lady I was gonna have to stop cause my mother.
I said, but  I would  help you  until  we get somebody to come in in my place.
Cause she didn't half see.
And so  the lady we were looking out for her, that's what I did.
And I had a-  I had all those papers and had to write up about Miss RD-NAME-1 but all that stuff went with the water.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Cause they had a big write up in the paper about her.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Well, I'll go  and try to see.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
But it was in the paper.
Mm-hm.
Lost everything.
When-  and see, the water had got trapped over here.
And- uh-huh.
And we couldn't come back over here right away.
And when they did let us come,  the bedroom  over there,  it had a bare roof.
I didn't even know.
I said, what is that?
The water had did it, so I didn't even recognize it.
Mm-mm.
I- all the furniture- that part- that furniture were messed up, I didn't even know.
Mm-mm.
My sister and her friend, they came with me in here.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Well I thank God for what they did.
Mm-hm.
Different ones.
But they was-  they was working through  First Baptist Church down  town,  like the post office over here, the  big church over here- on that side the ch- the- Mm-mm.
They was real nice.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
See I told you I was born over the railroad.
We came over here in the sixties.
Something.
I- Mm-hm.
I had all that.
Everything.
Well,  I know-  Well,  thirty some years.
Mm-hm.
Before I moved over here.
Not- the old school was out there where the old town hall- that's where I started school at.
Over there.
And  after we got to a certain grade, then we had to walk over town to Pattillo School.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, this school been here for my um,  youngest sister and brother but I was my mother's oldest child.
And then I got a brother in Norfolk.
I'm five years older than he is.
And the next brother, I'm ten years older than he.
And I was raised up with two brother,  and everybody else had a sister.
And I always wanted a sister.
And let me tell you what, if my mama had  married my stepdaddy,  I- I got a sister.
And I'm  twenty something years older than she is.
Then,  the doctor  told her she had a tumor and wanted to operate.
She said no.
Then she told her this not no tumor.
Said, cause I didn't have children, this is bad.
So  RD-NAME-2  was born, and then she had  uh,  RD-NAME-1  Then RD-NAME-1.
And then she had RD-NAME-2 and she told me said she wasn't gonna have no more children.
Said cause she did different with RD-NAME-2 than she did with the other child, sure enough she didn't have no more.
But from her oldest  to her baby girl  is  thirty years.
Mm-hm.
And they-  they my sisters and brothers but they seem like children to me.
Mm-hm, but I was older than they were.
Yeah, I'm the oldest one.
Mm-hm.
Um,  the-  uh-  RD-NAME-2, I'm five years older than he.
And then- Hm?
Mm-hm.
.
Then RD-NAME-3  I'm ten years older than he.
And then she didn't have no more children til she had this girl.
I didn't know how- exactly-  I mean RD-NAME-3 was about sixteen or something when  RD-NAME-2 was born.
Mm-hm-hm.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
Mm-hm.
Um,  my younger sister came from Seattle.
And she  on the next street from me.
And my brother had been in Florida-  youngest brother, he over there with her.
No, I didn't stay here my whole life.
Where?
I lived-  stayed in Virginia to work awhile.
Uh-huh.
And- not too long.
And then,  I forgot how many years I stayed  uh,  near Birmingham, Alabama.
And from there,  back home.
Mm-hm.
Mm- Yeah, I was in my twenties.
Mm-hm.
About five years.
Mm-hm.
That was my first marriage.
Uh, hm.

In Virginia.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Well I worked at the Navy yard  cleaning up and then worked in  service doing the messy work.
Mm-hm.
Mm, working in service.
I  worked- r- uh- walked along the railroad  um, on- w- on that-  further in the    Main Street for a lady named Mrs.
RD-NAME-1.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm,  yeah.
I worked a um-  I worked at P- at  Laundry.
It was  back of Thorne- used to be Thorne Drug Store on the depot.
I worked there awhile   and  when I left there I went to the plastic factory.
And I reckon I worked there about eight years before I started doing nurse's aid work.
Mm-hm.
Well at that time it was Carolina Enterprise but it done changed names.
Mm-hm.
And I started on this nursing uh, aid were-   Uh, when they would catch up the work sometime they would lay off until  uh,  coming onto the Spring,  and then they would  sp- bring you back.
And while I was um,  out,    um,  uh-  a lady name RD-NAME-3, she had worked in the hospitals and she was doing that work.
And she stayed down there  on the other side  the street in a cement block house.
And she was doing this private- do the nurse's aid, and she  was overloaded and she asked me did I want a job?
And I said, yeah, what is it?
And she said,  uh,  Sitting with the lady.
Said I'll stay with her nights if you work days.
Cause she had a day job.
And I said, oh okay.
I said but I haven't did that work.
She said well I'll tell you what to do.
And she did.
And so  this lady, she was a principal too.
And she  had cancer and somebody had to be there with her day and night.
And so when that lady passed,  then,  I went out to Edge-  Edgecombe Community College   and signed up but they were giving the-    they were giving the training  and  so   they didn't have quite enough for the class.
And so I- we- the lady told us if-  see if we knew anybody want to come.
So I went out and I recruited some and  we got enough for the class  and we went out there and we passed it.
I think it was  ten or twelve.
They wanted a certain number before,  you know, to sort the class up.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
