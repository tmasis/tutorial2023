Cool.
What does your father- What does your father do or did?
Hm.
And what about mom?
That is all.
No more writing.
Alright.
So tell me about- Let's start from the beginning, and we'll work up.
The good thing is I don't really know you, so I've never heard these stories.
Um,  so,  Columbia Hospital.
So where'd you grow up?
What- Fifteenth Place, is that correct?
Okay, so tell me about that neighborhood, your house- Mm.
Okay.
What do you remember?
Who are your two favorite football-  favorite football team and favorite basketball team?
Then are you a Wizards fan?
What's your basketball team?
Mm-hm.
Gotcha.
So,  I'll ask you about the bad stuff in a minute,  but  did you grow up in an apartment, a townhome- A house?
Are you an only child?
And you're the only brother?
I mean the only boy.
Okay, so tell me about that experience?
And you were just the innocent little boy?
I do.
I do.
Um,  so now- It wasn't that bad.
Which I'm surprised cause it was just you and your dad were the only guys in the house right?
And then, four women, but at different times, so it wasn't too bad.
So,  thinking about-  Have you gone back to your neighborhood?
So tell me about these friends you used to hang out with.
You can if you want, or you can just talk about them.
Gotcha.
What part of Northwest?
Mm.

Mm-hm.
So,  okay.

So how was that?
Do you feel like- Were you able to go back?
Hm.
What part of Southwest?
Oh, f- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
By the- by- by Arena Stage.
Mm-hm.
Like this condos, apartments or something- It was a lot.
So going back for a second because I think it was really interesting.
You're like, I'm not gonna tell you the bad stuff.
But then you just talked about like, the gunshots and- Right.
Was it the neighborhood- It wasn't you specifically?
Okay.
Um,  so what do you feel like was your  best memory in- before you moved.
So now going back to the neighborhood, right?
It's d- very different,  I'm assuming.
When they rebuilt it.
Um, what differences do you see now,  and does it feel the same?
H- Back to Fifteenth, like that area because- Like you f- I try not to watch the news.
Purposely.
Mm-hm.
Hm.
But just the people.
Kay.
So let's talk a little bit about your family.
Um,  you said your grandpar- your maternal grandfather was a DC native.
Your mom was DC.
Um- Oh, he grew up in DC as well?
So how'd your parents meet?
Do you know?
How old were they when they met?
Oh, like high school, maybe.
Just at the beginning of high school.
Wow.
And they were together that whole time?
Oh, okay.
Um,  and then, how did- Do you know how they kind of ended up together together?
You do not know the s-  Now, you're gonna go like, look, let me talk to you for a minute.
Um,  okay.
So then, your parents- You started in Northwest.
And then,  how did- Do you know how parents moved to Southeast?
Mm.
Gotcha.
And then,  so now- Do your fam- Does your fam- Are- Is your family still really close now?
And do y'all have anything like where y'all get together on Sundays or watch football games or- Oh okay.
Mm.
Really?
Okay.
So,  um, when you say y'all are close, what makes you close?
Like, do y'all have family traditions?
Oh .
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Gotcha.
Do your sisters still live in the area?
Oh wow.
So everybody's h- here pretty much.
Um,  so let's go back a little bit because now I'm gonna ask you  something not necessarily your family.
So let's talk about school.
Did you like school?
Mm-hm, before you got older.
Which- Which elementary school did you go to?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Where's RD-SCHOOL-2?
Is it still there?
I know RD-SCHOOL-2.
I don't know RD-SCHOOL-2.
Mm-hm.
The problem is I never go up Stanton Road, so that- mm.
I go that way, and then I come on Mississippi.
Like, cause I- There's a Club over there at the ARC.
So I'm there- Yeah.
Yup.
Um,  okay, so let's go- I know exactly where RD-SCHOOL-2 is.
That's what you're talk- Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
So that's on-  that's on Alabama Proper.
Yup, yup, yup.
Um, cause I have to go to that grocery store sometime- When I'm over at the Club.
Okay, so now I know-  Now I'm a little better oriented where you are.
Yes.
Like down from the Subway and the Giant?
Now I'm gonna have to pay attention- When I go back over there I'm gonna pay attention to it.
Um,  so  high school,  RD-SCHOOL-3.
Did your friends go there?
So how was that?
Okay.
Mm.
I'm sorry.
I could be watching you on TV.
In your mind.
Okay.
Well go- go.
I'm'a let you live in that fantasy.
I'm not gonna take that away from you.
I won't.
So I coulda been watching you on NBA TV.
And the season starts soon.
Mm, well we'll see what happens.
Um, so how was high school, then?
I haven't.
Mm.
You didn't develop new friendships?
Was it mostly black?
Was it mixed?
Right.
Right.
Cause  that neighborhoods that you were predominantly black, if not all black.
All black.
Mm.
Mkay.
So do you feel like-  I'm'a-  I'm'a divert for a minute cause I do wanna ask you about college.
But do you feel like,  in thinking about the city, has it changed much, like when you look around?
I know physically it's changed, but do you- Like, what changes do you see?
Mm.
Even in Northwest?
Mm-hm.
How was U Street changed?
Tell me from your perspective.
Mm.
And so how do you see it now?
Like what do you see when you think about-  when you think about where it was when you were a child, but now you go over to those parts.
Mm.
Do you believe gentrification is real?
Mm, wards seven and eight.
It's coming.
The fact that you can see her walking in t- ward-  in  Southeast.
I think it's coming.
Would you consider moving back to the c- Okay.
You're like, No, I'm good.
Okay.
So how did you- okay, let's go back to college then.
Um, how did you  get to RD-SCHOOL-2?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
And how did you get to- Like how did you ch-  from RD-SCHOOL-2 to RD-SCHOOL-2, like what made you say, oh, I'm gonna go to RD-SCHOOL-2.
Mm.
Mm.
After your first year at RD-SCHOOL-2.
So you finished your freshman year out, and then you started there?
So tell me how was that experience?
When you moved from-    Was it another culture shock?
What social activities did you do?
Like outside of the classroom.
Mm.
Did you um, pledge?
Did y'all have- I don't- I don't RD-SCHOOL-2.
Did they have fraternities and was it- was Greek life big?
Uh-huh.
Right.
I mean you had a black- Alpha.
I don't know.
I mean you just look like, if I had to cons- If I had to say, mm, he's a-  I would say, Alpha.
Mm-hm.
Maybe Iota.
Oh.
Mkay, well, nevermind then.
Um,  so  when you say that people  dress different, they talk different, they had a different mindset.
And do you have a word for that too?
Mm.
What-  When you say they think differently, what do you mean?
Like can you give me an exam-  Can you tell me like, what it's about?
I- And they don't like DC people?
You're not the first person I heard say that, and I-  but nobody really knows what the beef is about, right?
Like we can say, you know, we know there's like, Woodland Terrace,  Parkland, like,  Berry Farms.
We know they got beef.
That's just neighborhood turf beef.
But  DC and Baltimore are like,  forty five minutes to an hour apart.
I don't know why they got beef.
Yeah, I don't either.
If you ever find out, let me know.
Let you know?
Um,  so thinking about  kind of this- You talk about if you go to Baltimore - It's forty five minutes.
You've been there three times.
Think about DC.
DC is the nation's capital.
So tourist-y place.
Have you ever been a tourist in your town?
Have you done any of the other stuff?
Like the monuments, the capitol- Well, yeah But what made you as an adult say, You know what?
I need to go be a tourist.
Do you have a favorite one?
Mm.
Actually I wouldn't be able to ask you much cause I'm not very knowledgable.
So how'd you g- become- How did you get into mechanical engineering?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And now you don't do any of that.
Mm.
Mm.
Gotcha.
So what do you think you- What-  If you had to say, that's my dream job, what would that be?
Do you have a specific kind of car that you would really like to- Any kind of engine.
Ah, gotcha.
Wow.
And that's a big, like-  STEM in general is just like a big deal.
It's the- the buzz word these days, so.
Alright.
I'll be looking out for your name.
Design me some kind of engine or something, I don't know.
I don't know what I would need an engine for, outside of my car, but if I need one I'll call you.
Um,  so-  so you got older.
You love Abraham Lincoln.
Really?
Where'd that come- It just- something just- So how'd you end up at your current  job?
So this is my a random question, and it's just my own personal interest.
How do you know RD-NAME-3?
Mm-hm.
Aw.
Can I tell him that or- Oh.
I mean I could not- I could cut it off and like, say, No, RD-NAME-3, I can't tell you.
Um, but I wouldn't.
Um,  so,  now,  you said you wouldn't move back to DC.
How'd you end up in  Alexandria?
Are you Alexandria or Arlington?
Mm.
And that was the only reason?
Do you hang out in Virginia?
So you just live there, work there, but you hang out in DC?
Hm.
Do you see it- Is it different?
Mm-hm.
Like how?
Have you- Do you travel beyond just kind of Alexandria or Crystal City?
Hm.
You're going pretty far in.
I mean I know but that's-  I mean compared to somebody who's like,  Nah, I don't hang out in Virginia,  that's- that's kind of beat.
Okay, so come back.
So you live  like  right out-  right Crystal City, by airport?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh, route one.
Gotcha, so you're on that side.
You're not on the old town side.
Right right right right.
So you're at- But you're at the junction of the highway.
Got- Now, I know- I was just over there yesterday.
Um, so now I know where you are.
Okay.
Alright, so y-  That's- Yeah, nah, that's not that far then.
Cause you're on the other- I thought you were on the like, up- Like,  um-    Like by the Target and all that on that side, closer to the airport side, not on the other side.
Potomac- I couldn't- I couldn't think of Potomac- Yes.
Okay, so you're not on- Okay, now I gotcha.
Um,  so  couple of other questions for you.
What do you think-  If you could leave one piece of advice  to like,  the young-  Before I say that,  all the stuff that's going on in the news, especially with young black men,  um-  It's just scary.
It's a lot going on.
I don't watch the news, but I hear about it unfortunately.
If you could leave one piece of advice  to-  to young black men,  but also just to the youth in general, what would that piece of advice be?
Hm.
Hm.
Right.
Do you mentor?
Do you feel- And why not?
Yeah.
How old are they?
Oh- Oh.
You're toddler-  Ooh.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh, okay.
So almost coming up.
Tell me about that.
I mean, not ne- I mean, just about your daughters.
You don't have to tell me the other- Unless you want to.
Well now you're gonna make me ask.
Mkay.
What are your two daughters' names?
RD-NAME-2.
And what do you- do they- now, do they play with each other?
Do they live with you?
No, okay.
So  how often do you see them?
What do y'all do when y'all get together?
Are you like, let's go to the park.
Let's play basketball.
Mm, mm-hm.
Oh.
Do you, um, do they- are they from DC?
I mean do they live in DC or they Virginia, Maryland.
Mm.
Hm.
So,  do you want- do you want anymore kids or you- You're done?
That's it?
You got your two girls.
You don't wanna go for the boy?
Okay.
Well, you said no.
Um,  and  are they daddy's little girls?
Do- Are they wra- Are you wrapped around those little fingers?
That seems surpri- You seem so mild mannered, like- Mm.
Yeah.
Cause you seem really relaxed, but I can see like, sit down, be quiet, get it together.
Mm-hm.
Um,  okay.
So let me ask you about this.
Um, I wanna go  ask you a quick question.
What's your favorite book?
Why?
Mm-hm.
The Power of Now.
Mkay.
I need to read that.
Really?
Cause I have a lot  just stuff going everywhere.
Hm.
What's your favorite TV show?
Or movie.
A popular one.
Why?
Mm.
Okay.
Um,  you talked about  DC as a little  different, where you talked about the carry out.
I think this is really interesting, cause I was not  aware of  carry out.
I also called it the Chinese place.
Um- Uh, well,  s- maybe.
Um, but what is that-  is carry out different from Chinese-  the Chinese- Is a carry out place different from a Chinese food place?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
What's the difference?
What's your favorite carry out?
Somebody else- I need to go try them.
Somebody else told me that.
Why?
Okay.
Do you like mumbo sauce?
Is mumbo sauce unique to DC?
You've never seen it anywhere else?
And mumbo sauce.
So what is mumbo sauce?
It's kind of just a mix of stuff.
What else is unique to DC?
I know you said the New Balance was kind of a DC thing, but that's not necessarily unique to DC.
What about go go music?
That's why I'm here.
Can you describe go go music for me?
What's your favorite go go band?
You don't like go go?
But you used to  party to go go.
So what's your most- What's your favorite memory  at a go go, whether you were partying or looking at the girls or whatever you were doing.
Mm-hm.
And that's what stands out to you.
Where did you go?
Like, where- I know you said they were- Did you go to like, clubs, parties?
Mm-hm.
So obviously it was a big deal because they even marketed to the like,  the  teens and the younger people.
But you were in Upper Marlboro,  which was not DC,  right?
That's what you were just saying.
They-  Is- This was- Club was in DC?
Do you still consider that the DC area though?
Like, Upper Marlboro, do you still consider that DC?
That's- That's Maryland.
That's not DC at all.
And what about Virginia?
Is that just a whole different animal?
Okay.
