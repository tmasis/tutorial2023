Five wings, fried rice.
Oh no but I like the vegetables.

Five wings, fried rice, add egg, hot sauce and mumbo sauce on everything.
Okay.
Mm.
Really?
So okay, what's the difference between like a carry out and Chinese restaurant?
Are they different or that's the same?
Okay.
So you can't sit down?
Who?
What's it called?
Mainland?
Oh but most of the time you can't?
Like they had that one stool or that one bench?
Okay.
Mkay.
So,  t- okay, Jerry's on Eastern Avenue.
But that's not where you grew up.
I know but that's not-  that's near Seat Pleasant?
Oh when you come- when you cross over the line.
Okay okay okay okay I was- I- I was thinking- Nevermind.
I was over on this side of town, sorry about that.
Alright.
So,  you ain't like school, so what did you do?
What did you do- what- what made you happy?
Okay.
Okay before we talk about the streets let's talk about sports, what sports do you like?
Teams?
Okay a local boy.
And Miami Heat, okay well let's talk about the Miami Heat cause I'm not really into football.
Mkay.
Yes.
Thank you.
I like them too.
It was a sad situation.
I was hoping they would pull it out.
Every year, I know.
Right, like last year- Up three one, and then they lost.
Up three one.
I was really hoping for uh, conference finals this year but uh, Penguins.
Well You were right on your expectation.
Sports ain't- it ain't-  They getting better but they not consistent.
What you think making them better?
You think so?
Yeah.
Right.
You think so?
Okay we'll see.
I'm'a come back to you in December and be like, mm.
I'm actually not.
No I'm not a football fan.
No I can talk about basketball.
I'm not.
Now I did come from the South.
And we-  high school and college football are like life.
Like that's it.
It's football, Jesus, and soul food that's- that's what you do right there.
Uh, so I- I know a lot about football,  but I'm-  no.
Well,  um- They did it.
I like the Wizards.
Um,  I appreciate San Antonio,  and I marvel at Golden State.
It is but you know what let me tell you what I want Miami to do.
I need Miami to challenge- I really don't like Cleveland.
I do not, I'm not a LeBron fan.
When- when he was at the Heat I mean that made sense.
When he left the Heat I'm sure you weren't a fan.
Right.
Except his brand.
That's- that's who he need to have loyalty to.
Go deep.
Mm.
Cause it's the entertainment.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
If not close to it.
Yup.
Is it all hundred- I don't know if it's all guaranteed.
Yeah.
Thirty-three guarantee- You right, you right.
With player option, blah blah blah blah blah.
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah.
But he has the no trade clause, right?
I think he did.
They trying to make him though.
The Knicks thought he could.
I don't s- Steph Curry gonna sit down like that.
What?
Unanimous MVP?
He not doing it.
But when s- cause when he said, oh I still spill the champagne, oh LeBron he ain't forgot that.
He ain't forgot- The recent- you talking about yesterday?
Yeah.
And he was what, third pr- third place?
Third?
No-  In history.
Yes.
In first place.
Yeah.
Nobody voted for him .
But I won't- you think they gon- you think- okay, so you think- You think he's gonna go seven?
He is.
I wouldn't be surprised if they won.
He had to say it.
It was-  Irk- it was irking him.
What do that mean?
First unanimous like- He got- so-  Well you can get- no you can get- you get to vote for five places, first place, second place, third place, fourth place, fifth place.
Uh-huh.
He got- everybody voted for him for first place.
anyone else?
Nobody else has done that in his- For first pla- they did second through fifth place.
first place, nobody voted for no one else?
No, just Steph Curry.
So,  okay let me ask you this then, let's go back to the Miami Heat cause I'm really-  like I'm- I'm watching this series right, like I- I follow- Now I don't do a lot of football even though I was really big into football in high school I really fa- follow basketball.
And so I w- I'm watching Toronto, I'm watching- you know I'm feeling  some kind of way- But why didn't the Heat take care of business earlier?
Because I think- I think  NBA- Everybody wants to see  Heat, Cavs- When Whiteside went out?
So what- Okay then what's gonna happen when- Small ball.
It's really small.
Right.
But what is Toronto doing for real for real?
Toronto is weak.
They're good regular season.
I'm worried about game seven though, Toronto- what?
Explain it.
You think they gonna go- you think LeBron going to the finals twelve oh?
You think he gonna sweep the Heat?
Six?
Six?
But they gonna get a game.
Five.
Who coming back?
Whiteside coming back, Dwayne Wade coming back, I mean next season after free agency.
Mm-hm.
It's a scary thing, yeah.
Pat Riley make some miracles happen.
Westbrook ain't coming- no Westbrook is not coming to Miami.
Westbrook is not g- Let me tell you what's gonna happen to Westbrook, Westbrook's gonna stay in Oklahoma and then he's gonna go to the Lakers.
Westbrook is- He is.
And he has respect for Luke Walton and I think Luke Walton is gonna be a excellent coach for the Lakers.
Kobe ain't there no more.
Exactly but this is why- Right but at what point- So if- But   But let me- I think Kevin Durant made Wussell Restbrook's name big first of all.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Because until KD went out- until KD went- until KD went out, Russell Westbrook was a afterthought.
He wasn't an afterthought, but he was- He- Oh he most- I- All props.
All props.
That's what I'm s- But before Kevin Durant went out the- last year with the knee or foot whatever he went out with, Russell Westbrook was in the shadows, when he went out, he got to come to the limelight.
But when he went out, and then he got better.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
Mm.
But when did he get- when did he get- when did he move from  here-  I'm talking about just simple name recognition, household brand.
When did he move from here  to here?
When KD went out.
I'm not gonna doubt you on that, in fact scoring champion last year.
So where was he- when Kevin Durant was MVP two years ago,  where was Russ- Well,  I mean I don't know.
And- Okay.
LeBron, I still see him more a defensive  than offensive.
Agreed.
Agreed, agreed.
Cause all his injury- he was injury prone, all that.
Yeah.
That's why this latest decision.
No he wasn't, he didn't even come til he was finals MVP.
With the- Who, Kawhi?
Or Russell?
Oh I forgot- yeah cause he was coming off of his- yeah but he was- Bulls need to completely rebuild.
And that- that needs to be his team.
Is that gonna be his team though?
Who gon- who take- who gonna take Derrick Rose though?
But don't you have a roster of like, forty-something people?
Exac- that's my point.
But he gon- ain't it-  not free agenc- this year, is it next year?
That's a very mommy thing that she just did.
Who's the greatest player of all time in your opinion?
Basketball.
I don't know enough about other sports to have a conversation with you.
Mm.
I agree with that, yeah.
Contemporary, so in the last five years.
Hm.
Okay.
Well we'll see- we'll see how this next series go.
Mostly lose.
The worst.
I mean your team became great.
Missed the playoffs.
Yeah.
He- he-  And I don't like him, but he is- I- on the court.
Genius.
He is- I- I can't take it away from him.
Okay.
We could talk about basketball all day cause I watch  way too much basketball, I listen to NBA radio all day long.
I  have the basketball app on my phone.
Okay.
Of course.
Ooh.
So,  obviously not James Harden.
Oh, which are different.
Okay so best two way player I might be- it might be last series excluded,  Kawhi Leonard  or  Klay Thompson, I really- I think Klay-  I think Klay is- Klay is a beast.
Yes, I agree.
Uh, now best all around player?
I wouldn't either, because I think- when I think about all around player I think about  your two way player  but your leadership on the court,  I think about so many other things that go into- Yeah.
All that is- and I don't- Mm.
He's one of my favorites.
And he is the heart- I don't care what- I love Steph Curry.
I'm a Steph Curry- I awe at Steph Curry.
But Draymond Green- What?
I said I awe at Steph Cur- I love me some Steph Curry but Draymond Green is the heartbeat of that team.
You take Draymond Green out that team, They're not the same, they're not the same.
And Klay Thompson, they're beasts.
They don't have their heartbeat.
Draymond Green brings them energy, No  he brings them-  he brings them- I- I never said you were- I never said that- agree or disagree when you said that.
But I still know they do numbers- way more numbers when Stephen Curry  Oh most definitely- oh most definitely.
But they can still win without Steph Curry.
They can't win- no  winning now, no they can't.
Yes, yes.
No, you didn't say-  you didn't say- Going to the finals now going against OKC?
I wouldn't- it- I would- I- I couldn't put my money on it.
But against Portland, against, um,  the Rockets in their poor state- But you didn't say  I don't know.
That's what I'm saying.
I- it- No, I think- I don't think- I disagree.
He is now he does not get his props.
The whole team.
The whole team.
He did.
Most improved player.
Yup.
No that- that court- no, I won't s- I won't s-  He is, I love him.
I love him, I love the  the- the commercial- I- one of my favorite- I have two favorite NBA commercials.
It's the one with Steph and Obama, I love that one the my brother's keeper commercial, And he's like, yeah you don't need this clip art on your resume.
And then my other commercial that I like is the one he talks about motivation, when it's Dame Lillard talking about the motivation.
And he says you know all these snub blah blah blah, he says,  that's just keeps me going I love that commercial, like I show it to kids.
I watch it.
Draymond the heart of the team?
Huh?
Why y'all feel like he's the heart of the team?
All I'm saying is- No I don't want you to give me a- No I don't want you to give me a metaphor or nothing like tell me exactly what he do on the  Yup.
Skilled but soft.
Skilled.
So Draymond, he gave them the confidence they need.
Just like he said I just- we gon- yeah we gonna finish them out.
Yeah.
Like ain't nobody else on that team gonna say that.
Nobody.
Cause nobody else is gonna say it on that team.
So he's the one that be getting on them when they all slacking off and  So he like the father.
No that's Steve Kerr.
He's soning them.
Yes, yes I'll go with that.
Okay.
True.
Who is it for the Heat?
You think so?
More than Bosh?
Smacking that ass, smacking that ass.
Who's that for Bulls, it's Jimmy Butler?
I think he's more than Derrick Rose, it ain't s- No.
You think he leaving?
He going, he leaving.
They- they- that team is gonna rebuild totally around Jimmy Butler.
It is.
And-  Butler and Hoiberg.
I love him.
I love him.
And he has heart.
I love- I love me some Jimmy Butler.
Two-thousand twelve?
Two-thousand- Wait when's- Wait, you're- Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Who was on the team?
So he left and came back?
Yeah.
Oh he hasn't left, oh okay okay.
That's enough.
The eight.
Oh.
Oh he was on- okay.
Cause I wasn't- see I wasn't- Mm, basketball didn't come into my life until the last few years.
And they won two straight?
It's one of them.
Right.
Oh okay well- no well- cause I don't- I can't- I can't- I can't ask you questions about them cause I don't really know about football like that.
Okay.
So you a hometown sports except basketball?
Oh, who your baseball team?
Oh  Boston.
Boston Red S- okay.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
So let's- let's move away from basketball cause we could talk about- I could talk about basketball all day.
Like trust- I'm way- I'm way deep.
Um, so  kind of thinking about- going back to you said you- you know you and your sister y'all was kind of  doing your own thing, what does that mean?
Or like what-  And not- you don't have to get into deta-  I want whatever you feel comfortable.
But- Mm-hm.
Right.
Do you ever feel like there was a time like when you was out doing what you was doing,  that you felt like, oh my god I'm finna die like,  I'm in some real dangerous stuff right now?
Mm-hm.
Right.
Yeah.
Was there a time you remember specific like getting shot at or like, having to run or whatever something like a specific- can you tell me about like a specific time you remember?
Mm-hm, mm.

Go ahead- okay.
But go- we'll finish up so   But um- But w-  but so your first daughter.
So are you close to your parent- to your mom?
How did you and your mom- What-  what do you feel like- So,  growing up I know it's- y- it's your mama, you trying to be rebellious, you trying to do-  but what was that moment that made you be like,  that's my mama.
Like,  no, that's my mama that's my baby.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
On the bus.
Mm.
Yeah.
That's true.
So,  I have two more questions for you.
Um,  do you think the people like around this way  like especially in DC, espe- cause you went to Mississippi too, I don't know if you could think about that far back,  do you think  they have any special words or they talk differently?
Um, or they  can like-  they say things  in a s- in a different kind of way?
So-  What y'all s- what- what do you say in DC that's-  that makes you different?
Like what does that mean?
Mm.
B?
B is New York?
Oh I've never heard that.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Who?
No.
What else?
Bruh.
Bruh.
Bruh is everywhere.
Brody okay, what about like joint, what about bama?
And soning.
And- and son What does that mean?
Same as joint?
Oh, like- Okay.
What's a word you just- you just said it like a few minutes ago and I'm- I didn't write it down cause I was- No you said something when you were telling me a story about, um-   We were talking about sports and you said something and I didn't wri-  poorly on my part I didn't write it down to ask you about it.
Anyway,  what about, um, you just said it.
Oh my god, this is gonna drive me nuts.
Oh well.
Alright.
If you could do- let me ask you this, two- uh, sorry one more- two more things actually.
One,  do you like go go music?
Why not?
Okay, that was clear.
What kind of music do you like?
Ah.
Mm.
What's your favorite type of music?
Or favorite artist.
I do not know Kevin.
Tell me a little about Kev-  Obviously not.
Mm, mm-hm.
Do you like Kendrick Lamar?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
He's a lyricist.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
Pro black.
And that's different, those are very different things.
Any time you hold the door for somebody and the person that comes through the door, and then you realize you holding it for a white person, you're like, I just held the door for him.
You're anti white.
You- you- You caught yourself because you held the door for a white person.
What?
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Right.
Mm.
My last question, if you had to leave a piece of advice, especially now that you're ha- about to have a new daughter, new wife and-  what would that piece of advice be?
And it doesn't have to be just  to- to her or to the baby, but to anyone.
What does that mean?
Mm.
Yeah.
Is there a different- this my last-  Because I think that's really good, something I heard you say and I think it's been a bit controversy in the- especially in the black community- is there a difference between N-I-G-G-A and N-I-G-G-E-R?
Mm.
Mm.
Excellent, thank you so much.
Is that rain?
Oh my gosh.
Oh my god.
I appreciate you.
