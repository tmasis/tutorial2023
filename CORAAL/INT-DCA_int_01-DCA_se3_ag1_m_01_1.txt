So tell me exactly  from the beginning everything you do.
Uh-huh.

Do you ever play a game where one kid has to chase everybody else?
What's that called?
Okay, how do you-  how do you handle that?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
So the person who was tagged by the person who was it  is the next one gonna be it.
Okay, now how do you pick the-  When you're first starting out, how do you pick someone?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Um,  do you know any other rhy- or do you  remember any other rhymes  that are like that?
You use for- No?

I know I always did as a kid.
We always said or.
Some people say more.
Yeah.

Interesting to find someone else.
Uh, is there one about Engine Engine that's gets used around?
Something like that anyway.
How about- Let's see.
Here's another one a kid gave me the other day.
Something about my mother your mother had a fight?
Something like that.
It's all kinds of 'em.
Uh, is there a game where one  uh-  where a bunch of kids hide on one kid and one kid has to find 'em?
How does that work?
Mm-hm.
Oh, that's good.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh.
Let me ask you one more thing.
Are there any games with bottle caps that you play around here?
Mm.
But you haven't played that one in awhile?
These kids in New York play that quite a lot.
Uh,  do you watch TV?
Very much?
Oh, a little busy for- for that.

The next question is do you have a pet?
I can see you do.
How long have you had it?
Mm-hm.
What made you call him Bear?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Hm.
That's a good idea.
Why don't you put what kind of a dog he is on tape?
Mm-hm.
Has he ever done anything funny or  there have been any incidents about  Bear that you remember?
Sometimes puppies'll do something funny or.
No?
Do you ever have any other kind of pet?
Oh.
What happened to them?
Mm.
Hm.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Hm.
Did any of them talk?
Sposta to talk but sometimes  it's hard to teach 'em.
Uh, let's see RD-NAME-2.
About your school, what do you study?
What all are you taking?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Where do you go to school?
Mm.
Mm, we almost interviewed some kids from your school.
It fell through.
What do kids do when school is out?
After school.
Mm-hm.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
What-  uh-  How many grades does it cover?
Oh the whole twelve.
Uh,  what do kids do with their free time after they get home from school?
Hm.
Hm.
You do a lot of studying.
Hm.
They really lay it on you, hm?
Hm.
You get pretty good grades?
Hm.
Must be a tough school then, huh?
Hm.
That's a lot of subjects, isn't it?
How many is that?
Sounds like it's about six or eight.
Wow.
You ever have a teacher that hollered a lot?
Oh yeah?
What do they holler- Is it a man or a woman?
What does he holler about?
Hm.
Just a grouchy guy.
Did he ever pick out you to yell at?
For any reason.
What about?
At nothing?
Oh.
Hm.
What about the best teacher you ever had?
Oh.
Same Mr RD-NAME-2 that  I know?
Maybe not.
Uh,  let's see.
What as so good about them?
Oh.
Was there ever a teacher that you just couldn't stand?
A  somewhere?
Oh good, you were lucky.
Were you ever in a class where the kids played a trick on the teacher?
Practical joke of any kind.
What happened?
Hm.
Mm.
Didn't get any reaction out of her?
Anything else like that or any-  Mm-hm.
Did her-  a reaction that time?
What they do?
Holler or what?
And that was all huh?
Let's see.
Is there a bunch of kids that you  hang around with and do things with?
Sort of your group.
Mm.
In the past did you?
In the past has there been groups that were sort of your- Let's see.
Have there ever been uh,  anybody in  in one of the groups that you played with do people speak any foreign languages?
Oh.
But none of them like- Their- their parents .
Oh my.
Must have known it good then.
Musta spoke French pretty well then huh?
Oh.
Is there any white kids in your group?
In any group that you played with, was there a-  ever one person that everybody looked to as the leader?
Everybody sort of  waits for them to decide what to do?
Uh, what- what was there about that person do you think?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Would he help with homework and that stuff or?
What if a new kid wanted to  join the group, what would he have to do?
Anything special?
How would he go about  making friends with  everybody?
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Do you have any idea what you wanna be when  you get done with all your education?
Hm.
That's good.
How long will it take you?
Mm-hm.
A long haul, huh?
Uh,  what  kind of a doctor would you be?
GP or?
Yeah, it's a little early to decide that.
If you had all the money  in the world you wanted, what would you do with it?
Mm.
Why not?
How does your family celebrate the holidays?
Hm.
What about Christmas morning?
What all do you do special for that?
Mm-hm.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Hm.
How about decorations and that?
You don't help  much?
Uh.
Huh.
What was the best Christmas present you ever got?
Or birthday present or?
Oh yeah?
What was that like?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Where do you use it?
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Do you know how to s-  sail, do you?
Or do you have to go with someone.
Yeah.
It's kind of .
I've never tried it myself.
I'd probably land in the water.
Uh, what would you like for Christmas this year, if you have your choice of anything you wanted?
Oh.
Hm.
Say,  so you're restricted to grown up things.
Clothing or anything like that or?
And how about child things, huh?
Doesn't ring a bell huh?
Oh, it's okay.
Now this is a more serious question.
But were you ever in a situation where you thought you might die?
You might be killed?
No?
Do you ever dream about it?
What was the dream like ?
Hm.
Mm-hm.
You always land in bed on those deals, huh?
Sometimes people say well, whatever's gonna happen is just gonna happen.
There's nothing you can do about it.
Do you agree with that or?
No?
What would you say to that?
If someone tried to argue that way with you.
Mm-hm.
How about if you knew someone who  got struck by a car or something and injured seriously.
And two of your friends were arguing about it.
And one of 'em said, well, he shoulda watched his step, and the other one said, well, it was just his time.
Which one would you agree with?
