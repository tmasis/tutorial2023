Yeah.
You know, basically when I-  when I was growing up- Mm, yeah.
S-  live on the farm  until I was about-  probably about twelve years old,  then the- stay at my grandmother.
After that, I moved.
Um, start staying my mom,  My mom and stepfather, he was in um, military so  we left there, went to like  Georgia.
Didn't stay in Georgia long, then we lived um, New Jersey.
Stayed there probably- probably about  just about  three years.
And after we m- um,  left New Jersey,  that's when we went down to Panama.
And went to Panama f-  for three-  three and a half years.
Then after we left from  Panama, that's when we came back-  back down here.
Uh, six- sixteen.
Sixteen.
Left in between the age of eleven and twelve.
Yes.
When- On Tarbor- It's out um- Matter of fact, it's on the old- old sixty four.
Like you going to Rocky Mount.
That little farm out that way.
Just a kid.
Chopping- chopping wood,  put it on the porch for my grand-  my grandparents.
And basically that's it.
Just being- just being a kid.
Run around, bicycles, falling off bicycles, skinned up, little stuff like that.
Yeah.
No, they- they worked on a farm.
Yeah.
No, it was- Yes, someone else owned the farm.
They working for them, for this man on the farm.
N- Being hard headed.
My aunt um- just a normal day,  I was  calling myself going around the house, you know,  getting little broken bottles and stuff like that, throwing 'em on the trash pile.
My aunt told me,  just leave it alone, but me, thinking I'm doing something good, kept on being hard headed.
Got one,  that was busted, but didn't know it,  and I threw it  and split my thumb open.
Probably about  seven.
I'm still have the scar.
Still have the scar.
And just so happened,  no- just my aunt-  I think two of my aunts were just there,  and just so happened I think, a insurance agent  came over.
And that's how I-  I got from the-  from the house to the hospital.
Yep.
Then had to get uh,  mm, I was probably about  phew- prob-  be about good twenty-  probably a good twenty stitches.
Yeah, they had to-  had to take a couple people to hold me down cause they had to stick a needle in the inside of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was my aunt.
Yep.
Yeah.
Just- just basically just kind of-  kind of panic- I- I don't remember her-  her fussing at me then.
I think now,  one of my aunts, she fuss at me more  about it now than then.
Yeah.
That- just remember just- just getting my thumb.
Had a-  a pan of water, pulling my finger in it, dumping it, putting it back in.
Just-  just hard headed.
Just hard headed.
No just went there and- and stitched it up and know,  know came back.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Had to go to school with it all wrapped up and stuff like that.
Yeah.
My grandfather name was-  We called him RD-NAME-2, but his name was RD-NAME-2.
My grandmother name  was um, RD-NAME-3.
Yep.
Well that's when I-  I um,  think when I was- Probably like I say eleven, maybe twelve.
Uh-huh.
That's when I  started staying with them.
Yeah.
Cause when- At that- Around that time,  they were stationed in  either Texas or either Alaska.
Yeah.
Cause that's when  Texas where-  where my other brothers were born at, and Alaska my baby brother was born at.
Uh-huh.
My grandparents.
With my mom, yeah.
Well,  they did.
I just went to like,  like three places.
It was like Georgia but  really can't say Georgia, cause I think we probably stayed there   probably about-  pro- probably wasn't a month.
And then  like I said, went to um, New Jersey.
Think it was like,  two, three years we stayed-  we stayed in New Jersey.
Then he got um,  moved on to Panama.
Oh.
It was- Yeah, it was-  It was fun.
It was fun.
Going to there,  know,  meet a- meet a lot of know, different friends and stuff like that.
People and stuff like that.
You know, it was different.
Going to school,  know you had to go-  think it took me like-  think it was like  thirty minutes to get to school cause leave the base and then have to go over the Panama bridge, and then you know, go into  um, the town a little bit,  go to the school.
Yep.
Yeah.
Took the bus.
Mm, yeah.
It was-  it was- it was a nice place.
It was a nice place.
Yeah, I liked it there.
I mean it-  had a lot of-  had a lot of um, activities for you know, the kids to do.
Cause  as I got up there,  first thing I start doing is I start playing a little  football.
Yeah.
Ye- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
RD-SCHOOL-3.
Yes I went to um- went to RD-SCHOOL-1.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
It was-  what you mean?
I made it hard  for myself because I was basically just- Instead of just, you know, when I didn't understand something, just asking- I'll sit back.
I'll be  scared of what-  you know, what somebody gonna say.
You know, if I might-  You know, might not know a lot of things they might know.
I just might be scared that they ask the question, so I just basically just sit back.
You know, then try to figure out then-  Like I said, me being  hard headed, and stuff like that, I  either I learned or I-  you know, or I didn't.
Know if I-  Sometime I figured a way out, you know, to learn it.
Or, every n- Know, every now and then, I might  ask for their help.
But when I ask for it, I try to ask for it when it ain't nobody around.
Cause like I said  you know, just  know, embarrassed of  wondering what somebody else gonna say.
Yeah.
It was-  Like I said,  me, myself, I- I made it hard for myself.
Yeah.
I- I  can't recall their names, but just sitting here kind of like can  like see the classroom and stuff like that, you know.
Ooh.
Fourth grade would- starts- Had to be like the- When you start- But think it was like second grade.

It was more duties I had to do around the house.
You know, and like I said, when I was staying at my grandparents,  least the only thing I had to do then was just-  just um, chop wood and put it on the porch.
You know, then got with my parents, you know,  you know, started  doing more things.

Uh-huh.
RD-SCHOOL-3 Pssh  Being a clown.
Being a-  No, not really a class clown, but you know, just  not taking it seriously until about my  about  I can say about when I-  getting ready turn a senior.
That's my kind of life story, know, taking it serious.
Yeah.
Cause  I was just-  I was into sports, and  basically you need it- so you just did enough to-  do enough to get by.
Football and basketball and run-  and run track.
Yeah.
Football.
Hoo!
Play half back,  defensive back.
I was a field goal kicker,  returner, kick,  basically just stayed on the field.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I was- I was alright in it.
I was alright in it.
Yeah.
No I didn't-  I didn't go to college.
Hoo, after high school, I  just worked.
Yeah, different jobs.
Worked at RD-WORK-3 for a long time.
Worked at the  RD-WORK-3  for a long time.
RD-WORK-3, RD-WORK-3, just, you know, different jobs.
Yeah.
It was- RD-WORK-3.
Well I got two.
The one you work at now.
RD-WORK-3, it was-  it was alright, but I had a supervisor who-  who wanted me-  I did stock.
He wanted me to stock.
Like the guys who'd been there like four years.
And I was-  haven't even been there a month yet, and I'm tryna learn-  learn the system.
You know, stayed on my back and stuff like that, so.
Back then, know,  attitude.
Well,  see y'all later.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just- started looking for another job.
I think that's- I th- think that's how I  got to RD-WORK-3.
Good times.
Just him just staying on my back.
Yeah.
It wont so much you know, the job, because  I was learning the job.
But just the point of him-  Like I said just wanting me to  stock as fast as the guys who already been there years.
And I haven't been there  a month,  not even a good month.
You know.
Yeah.
It been years, that- I don't think they gonna come back and get me.
Yeah, I say times just  might make me real mad, I just go,  we unload the truck and have the stuff loaded- Back then, how you do it, you just  put the stacks in the middle of the floor.
You have like certain sections for what go where.
I've seen tires get stuff in there, just- just throw it.
I mean it- it'll go in the spot where it sposta go- where it, but I just throw it.
You know.
Just stuff like that.
Then,  like I said, get a little attitude, then I say he- well he gonna be on my back anyway.
Let me give him something to be on my back for.
You know, take my little time.
You know, do this, do that.
That's all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know.
I don't think it was two months.
I don't think it was two months.
I don't think it was two months.
Yeah.
No, it wasn't- After high school.
I was in my-  I don't- Can't recall what-  what day but it's  in my twenties.
Yeah.
Yeah.
RD-WORK-3.
RD-WORK-4.
That was  you go in-  Think we were going in like-  I think you had be in like, three o'clock.
Some mornings we ain't leave is  six.
No, the afternoon.
But you don't leave- Sometime we won't leave about three, seven, eight in the morning.
You had to come right back  at three o'clock.
You know, and  way- way how I looked at it, you- you worked them long hours like that,  and you come in- You come in  in the morning probably about three to  five minutes.
The man not work that long, you know,  let 'em come on in.
You know.
That- stuff like that kept happening.
Then, when my supervisor, he gonna call me upstairs- I think back then- Excuse me.
Back then, you couldn't-  you couldn't get no more than fourteen points.
And that particular day, well, he called me up there.
Yeah.
Well come in late.
Yeah.
So  that particular day, he called me up there,  had my paper and stuff laid out.
I was looking at 'em,  handwriting didn't look right.
So I ain't say nothing.
Started adding up my points.
So he got to talking.
So I just- Basically I just told him, I said, for one,  if you're tryna get rid of me, get someone who can write my name right.
I said, and the other one,  before you get fired, you sposta have a fourteen points.
I said, you count these up, it's twenty three.
And I walked out.
He told me, don't walk out.
I looked at him,  and I went on about my business.
And after that, I stayed there  probably another month.
Probably a month.
You know, best way- I j- I just stayed away from him  until I- Like I say, til I got me another job.
Cause by-  I think that was right about the time when my-  when my mom,  dad, aunts, and them used to tell me, you know, sometime you just got to put up some stuff until you find you another job.
You just can't hop up and just leave like that.
And see, like I said, basically,  when I was first started working though,  basically that's all-  you know, that's all I do.
You know.
But I like I s-  You know I'm learn-  I learn now, it's just like  no matter where you work at,  you gonna have problems.
So you just can't just hop up and leave.
You know, sometime you just got to just-  some of it you just got to swallow sometime.
Just go ahead- You know, go ahead about your business  cause  like I said, long run, it'll-  it'll pay off.
You know, find you something-  find you something a little better.
Yeah.
Just like where I'm at now.
You know, I like-  I like my job, but-  Do your work.
And they keep adding things on to you, you know, you would like to see or you gonna add this on to my- Alright, can I have a little more money?
But they talking about, they won't give me no money, so you know.
Like I-  Way how I see stuff,  if you want somebody to work for-  if the person is good- is a good worker,  you have to pay 'em.
In order to make money, you got to spend a little money.
And the way I see it, if you- if you got a good crew  that can work together and get the product out,  I don't see  you know  give 'em some money.
Cause that gonna make that person, okay.
Be happy when they come to they job.
Go ahead and work.
Don't-  You know,  like I said, you gonna have problems.
But you know, then problems be worked out a little-  little easier, little better, so.
But you know, that- that's just my opinion.
But you know, they-  you know, they see a little-  stuff a little different though cause I didn't go to college.
They probably went to college.
You know, this and that, so.
What is my word?
You know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You go- You go to work and-  You know, you bust your tail, but then you get the check.
You look at it, like,  Now why I come to work for?
I mean, that's-  I mean that's how I see it.
The job I'm at now- I had never seen a job where majority of the folks in there make about the same thing.
Making bout the same but doing different jobs.
You have some folks that's  probably welding, some of 'em probably making less than me.
In welding.
Then,  in that plant, you're dealing with a lot of steel, so sometime regardless of how you grab something, you get scars,  cuts and stuff like that.
So you know,  way how I look at it, that job right there need to pay more money anyway- with they- with the stuff you got to do in there.
I guess sometime guess it depend on how they feel.
Yeah.
That's the man right there.
He making about-  about nineteen dollar hour.
Superior C- Superior Cable.
I think they start you with like,  ten, eleven.
Between think it's- think it's- RD-WORK-5 Let me think uh, Wire.
Matter fact, think it's like the- fact the wire they have right here in the poles right here, I think that Yeah.
Yeah.
Wait- Oh sorry.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
In between Tarboro and some in Rocky Mount.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like- Just like at my job- Believe it or not, it's not that many  people from-  from Tarboro.
Most the people that work  where I work at is like from Scotland Neck or-  or Robersonville and- and a little from Rocky Mount.
There's not-  it's a couple in there from- you know, from Tarboro, but like I said, the majority of 'em is  from out of town.
How about Glenoit?
Glenoit?
Yeah.

Yeah.
Um,  think it's  twenty?
H- Twenty, RD-NAME-1?
People on the roster.
Twenty four.
Twenty four.
Tw-    RD-NAME-1 was in before I was.
So I had to be- How long you been here?
He been ten, so I been about  seven?
Nine?
No, I probably been about eight.
Cause you was like two years in before I was, about eight year.
Eight years.
Just a regular old fireman.
Regular old fireman.
Well, going all the way back,  and I was staying on the farm- That one that um-  RD-NAME-2?
Uh, call him my uncle.
Call him Uncle RD-NAME-1 but he really is my cousin.
And way back then when I was growing up,  he always told me,  come to the fire- come the fire department cause I remember the day  he come there, the first thing I do  is grab his-  grab his radio.
And he had one of the old ones, which  it had lights up here.
And they always go across, and if I always mess with it.
You know, turn the little knobs and stuff.
And then,  him?
You know, come to talk to 'em,  you know,  seeing him-  him being out here and the rest of the guys.
You know,  riding by some day, they out here, know,  Might be cooking out.
Know, playing basketball.
You know, every now and then you see the truck go out,  so it was like,  you go and try it.
But when I first got in, it was more like,  ready to go.
Ready for the whistle to blow.
But now, after you see the-  the deaths,  and the people, you know, losing stuff.
People lose-  lose their property.
And lose their lives.
I don't care if it blow or not.
Don't care if it bow the car then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ever done seen  a man get burned the house, man get hit by a truck,  by a train.
Car turned over on him.
I mean- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
See what's- you know, see the stuff, you know.
You got to come, what, you know, getting it all,  the glass and all that stuff up, you know.
You know, stuff like that,  you know, basically ain't  really is not  too much what we could do, you know.
Just stand by, know, and just help.
The first one I think I saw when they was-  think they was j-  just doing this bypass out here.
And I  think the on-  think they were just fixing on the bridge  and b- matter of fact,  they didn't have  the double lanes.
Cause what you had to do  one lanes going the way you s- they was making it,  you had to go like you going straight, but then turn back into that traffic.
Yeah, and that's-  think it was the first one  that I had saw, cause,  that was when  I guess he just got thrown from the car.
And when- No, he- he just got thrown from the car.
And the car rolled though- Cause he- Cause when- how you going on the road,  you sposta be going straight.
And at the last minute, he saw that you had to turn, and he just snatched it.
And the car flip, just threw him out and then rolled on-  rolled on top of 'em.
Yeah-  No it was on the-  Not the bridge.
The bridge weren't there yet.
They were getting ready to build it.
It was still- They were still doing the um- the highway then.
Yeah.
First- When I first got there,  first thing I see when we got there,  I see a-  where the car at.
Hit the car-  He musta landed right- right- right here, and the car was over here.
First thing I looked at,  just laying back.
And this-  I think it was this leg- He was laying this way, but this leg was back this way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It- it- it-  it stays with you.
You know, stays- You know, stays in your head for a good period of time.
You know, just like y-  you'll- you'll keep remembering.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think the  two worse-  When the guy got cut by a train.
Hit by a train.
He got cut in half.
It was- that one in-  Matter of fact the one, Right.
Naw- Not a light.
Where the eighteen wheeler hit a guy?
No, light wont there.
Yeah.
And  Sound nasty, but just  seeing him laying there with his-  with his head bust open.
Know, his brains on the side.
Yeah.
Matter of fact it was- It was me and you, wont it?
He had to pass me to come back to get-  come to here to get the truck.
Yeah, so we had to come by, and then come get the truck and go back.
Ready.
Ready for- Matter-  It was so bad with me  on Saturday mornings-  Think it was twelve o'clock, RD-NAME-1?
They usually, um, tone everybody out at the whistle blow.
And after I was just getting in, and I didn't have a  um,  pager.
The whistle blew.
I ran from the house down here.
And I'm just looking around.
I'm like, where everybody at?
And that's when I found out you know,  on Saturday morning about twelve,  they blow every-  test everybody's pagers and the siren.
But you know, it was like, ready for it.
You know, ready for it to go off.
Like I said, now  I don't even care if it blow or not.
Yeah.
Every now and then though, a little-  little grass fire you know,  might be alright, but  just think about somebody house  catching on fire, yeah.
Who can lose their life in the house or  lose the house?
Uh, that's-  that's not a-  that's not a- that's not a good thing.
It's not a good thing.
No.
You know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause it's a lot of people that  when I-  when I tell 'em I'm in the fire department,  and they- first thing they ask,  what do you get paid?
I was like,  uh, no.
It's volunteer.
Ain't no way I can volunt-  It's- You know, it's-  You'll-  You'll give it more respect once you get into it, and you start dealing with it.
Cause like I say, it's- it's a nice thing to get into, like I said.
I don't care if the whistle blow or not.
I don't care if the whistle blow or not.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's-  You got to look at it in-  To me, it'll-  it'll help you out in life.
Help you out in life.
It's just like-  just like  dealing with him.
You know,  learning  is like,  a- like a l- business.
So you know, you given more responsibility.
You learn- you learning more things.
You learning different things.
How they- Just like,  I'm still working on it now but  I didn't know how to put in, know, fire reports.
So you know, that's- that's something there, working with a computer that  I'm learning how to- I'm learning how to do.
You know, he gonna show me different things, how to- how to deal with the computer.
So you know it-  Way I look at  responsibility.
It's with responsibility cause  just like me and him,  we tight,  but  if  I'm doing something slack, he not gonna let it go by.
I made-  He change into a different mode then.
Cause see, that's- that's my assistant chief right there so at that point in time  that's  the fire department coming out so that's what he have to do  is to get me back on line.
But you know,  like, say know,  little fudge, you know, this and that, but after that  you know, back to the same old person.
Yeah, so.
Like I said, it's-  it's a learning experience.
Helps you out a whole lot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then like,  not so long ago.
It helps you like,  different schools.
Um,  Roberson School,  they had called,  you know, they wanted some guy to bring the fire truck out.
It just so happened I got off work early that day,  so you know, came and we took the truck down there.
And to see the expression of the kids  when that truck rolled up, and then to see 'em after you  you know,  spraying the water.
See them out there jumping around, loving the wat-  It makes you feel- makes you feel real good.
Makes you feel real good.
Yup.
Then especially when  I had one  that come up to me  and he was like,  I want to be a fireman.
And  I just asked him, I was like, well,  how you doing in school?
He said, um-  He said, I'm doing good in school.
And I was like, well,  that's the first thing.
You make sure you do good in school.
See my thing is-  Just like with my kids now,  I tell 'em,  I act up enough in school for-  for all of y'all.
So it's no need for y'all to go to school and act up.
Because it's- it's getting hard now.
You- Everything what they teach you now, you gonna need to know, and you gonna need it, know, for the- help you in life.
So  I stay on 'em and tell 'em,  it's just, you need- need to do what you need to do in school.
Cause, like I said, one of my problem was  afraid of what somebody was gonna say if I asked a question.
Don't worry about that.
Let them say what they got to say.
If you don't understand, ask the question.
Don't sit back there  like I did and just, well,  see if I can get it later.
Go ahead and ask the question for you can know.
For you won't have to s- for you won't have to struggle.
You know, I know there gonna be some things that you gonna have a problem with,  you know,  cause I mean I looked at some of the- some of the stuff they doing now.
I look at it and shake my head.
You know, like, man.
Just like,  some of the-  like some of the math problems and stuff, they- they got to go through and cause it's a lot of more steps and stuff they got to go through.
Yeah, a lot 'em.
Yeah I have three.
Yeah, two boys- two boys and a girl.
Twelve, eight and five.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they-  And they need to listen.
And it- And listen.
And it's-  Believe it or not, it's-  My opinion is  teachers-  some teachers- I'm'a say some teachers-  I feel just there for a paycheck.
But then you can find some that really-  really care about kids.
Really care about kids.
They'll stay there the extra step helping kids learn what they need to learn.
And see  like my daughter, she have a teacher that  she loves to death, and I'm- She stays on 'em.
And like I talked to her one day, I said, you have a teacher right here that-  that care about you, that want you to learn.
I'm not gonna let you go this class  and-  and disrespect her like that.
You're not gonna do it.
And see then it's good too cause with my mom,  she's out there know, what she- what she do the um, like a tutoring  class though.
Helping with the homework stuff, after school program stuff.
Yeah, sh- but she help with the after school program, stuff like that.
So you know,  lots of time it- my job is-  i-   it's easy.
And like I tell them,  if your grandma tell you something, don't look at me.
If anything, both of us get a whooping.
I mean, I'm thirty two years old and I'm not gonna back talk my mom.
And least for both of us to be sitting there  I got- done got a spanking for something you done did.
You want me to- I'm not gonna do it.
And I tell you, don't look at me.
Cause if you did something bad, gonna get a spanking.
I see she gonna get you,  I'm going outside.
I ain't got- I ain't got nothing to do with it.
I didn't do it.
And she- and she tell 'em plenty time.
You do bad, I'm gonna get you.
So you know,  my parents-  I love 'em to death because they help me out a whole lot, a whole lot.
Sometime they-  they go overboard.
They go overboard.
Helping me out.
Yeah.
I mean, wish they-  they- my mom stays on 'em.
Every- Know, every now and then, you know, I might-  I'm- I'm slacking up.
She'll put me to the side,  she'll tell me quick, I don't care, you get mad.
I don't care, you get mad.
And she- you know, she tighten up on me, tell me what I need to do.
Yeah.
