The first thing I'll ask is  what sort of games you played as a child, if you can remember.
Uh,  how do you play basketball?
How many ?
Mm-hm.
How do you score?
Yeah.
I mean,  how do you count the points?
Uh-huh.
How do you get a point?
Is that one point?
Yeah.
Gee, I'm not anathlete so I don't know  any of these things.
Did you ever play any little kid  games where people chased each other or anything like that?
Do you remember?
Oh, how did that work?
Mm-hm.
What was the- Was there a  aim in that?
Or something you had to accomplish?
Oh!
Ah, that sounds like fun.
What age kids would play that game?
Uh-huh.
Did you ever play Tag?
Um.
Did you play anything  called Kick the Can?
Oh, you didn't?
How about baseball?
Were you ever in a baseball game?
Uh-huh.
Did you play for the school team?
What position did you play?
Oh.
Get a lot of action then.
Uh-huh.
Was your team pretty good?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
They're not doing too bad now.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Now you think you got troubles.
I'm a White Sox fan.
At least I was last year.
I think my wife is ready to switch .
What's wrong with the White Sox?
You seem like some baseball .
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
You think these new guys that they got are going to help them eventually?
Like Tommy Davis and them?
Mm-hm.
You would think so.
Wh- a-  The pitching isn't holding up to me.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
How high do you think the Senators are gonna get this year?
If you had to guess.
How high do you hope?
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh, the way they're going now, they just might surprise everybody.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
They did pretty well in the Grapefruit League.
Mm-hm.
They won all our Nat- games with the National League teams, too.
Surprised me.
Everyone thinks the National League's supposed to be good.
Who was the best player  that you remember on the Senators since you've been here?
In your opinion.
What did he play?
Mm-hm.
Yeah- When was this?
Sometime ago, or recently?
Oh.
Not Killebrew was it?
I think he did, I don't know Hm.
Do you ever watch TV?
What's your favorite?
Oh yeah?
What-  Could you tell me about one time when-  that it was particularly good on that?
What he had on?
Oh, who all did he have on there?
Mm-hm.
Do you ever watch any of their stories?
Oh.
Oh yeah.
Uh-huh.
Think they do a good job?
Your home state.
Do you go to movies?
Hm.
Well, can't ask you about a movie you've seen then.
They just revised that.
Uh-huh.
What was that about?
Hm.
What's the story of Gone with the Wind?
Do you ?
Mm-hm.
Do you have a pet?
Did you have one when you were a kid?
Oh yeah?
What kind?
Mm-hm.
Oh were you?
What kind of stuff did you hunt?
Hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
How did you do that?
What's- what's that like?
Get started.
Oh, it won't?
No kidding.
They're vicious huh?
They look so cute.
What did you do with a possum when you caught it?
Oh I see.
No kidding.
Oh.
That's not bad.
Hm.
That's what-  what I missed out on growing up around cities all the time.
Mm-hm.
Do they have mink down in North Carolina?
Oh really?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Noted.
Well how do these dogs get-  get on the trail of these animals?
Mm-hm.
How do you train one of those dogs?
Or do they just do it by instincts?
Hm.
There's nothing you can do to train 'em?
I see.
So they learn from the- Oh boy.
Yeah, that's interesting.
I wished I could have done that.
Never had the chance.
Thirty five dollars for a coon skin.
When it's cured right?
Hm.
Oh that's more  fascinating to me.
Uh,  what did you study in school?
That you remember.
No kidding.
What was so exciting about that?
Wha-  Where did the Dismal Swamp exactly fit into history?
I know I've heard the name, but I can't  place it in History.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I didn't think there was grizzly- Boy, I'm learning more things today.
I didn't know there was- They were that far east.
I thought- Hm.
They're all gone now, aren't they?
The bears?
Really?
Gee whiz Hm.
Incredible.
Y- I don't- Guess I never learned much about animal ?, but I thought they were all out west.
Wild America.
Do people hunt them there or is it too dangerous?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mkay.
Did you ever hunt  ?
Mm.
What else did you study besides history ?
Mm, remember any of the French?
Oh you didn't.
You took Latin instead of French.
Mm-hm.
Did you ever have a teacher that hollered a lot anywhere  along the line?
Oh yeah?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
What did she holler about?
Do you remember?
Oh.
Was it fair or  do you think she was picking on you?
Hard for kids to understand that.
Mm-mm.
No kidding.
Uh could- What- Who was the best teacher you ever had?
Would that be the one?
Mm-hm.
What was there about her besides her trying to correct you?
Mm-hm.
That's really important.
Did you ever have a teacher that you just couldn't stand?
What were they like?
Hm.
Hm.
Hm.
Oh, that's nasty.
Mm-hm.
When you were  back in your mischievous age,  did you or any of the kids in the class ever play any tricks on the teacher?
Mm-hm.
Never put tacks on their chairs?
Wouldn't think of it then huh?
Mm-hm.
Good.
That's funny.
Did you ever do any other things like that?
Mm, good.
When you were  that age or older even, was there a bunch of kids that you always hung around?
Mm-hm.
Do you ever see any of 'em any more?
Is there a group of adults that you associate with now?
More or less.
Were they all colored kids that you would play with?
Hm.
Okay, .
Uh, did any of-  besides what they learned in school- did any of  the kids speak any foreign languages?
Mm-hm.
Oh, very good.
Was there one kid  that was looked up to as the leader that you remember?
Who was that?
Oh yeah?
What was he like that made him such a good leader?
Mm.
It was partly his uh, singing ability.
If a new kid moved into the-  into the community, could he get into the bunch or  would he have to be initiated?
Mm-hm.
You think if anyone had moved in, would you have accepted them?
Mm-hm.
It's different sometimes in the city cause  if you have a group of kids, and if a new kid wants to get in, he's got to be- inaudible.
Take some kind of punishment or something.
Get beat up or-  Uh,  well that's really good.
If you could start your life over again, would you do anything different?
Mm-hm.
And that's the way you feel now?
Oh, that's great.
That's good.
What did you hope to be when you were a child ?
Didn't turn out?
Or were you a break layer?
Oh.
Hm.
Oh yeah?
Mm-hm.
Hm.
That's interesting.
What did you have to do to become a brick layer?
Was there a school?
You said you went to school?
Mm-hm.
How long did it take?
Hm.
What does a- What actually does a brick layer do?
I know, lay bricks of course, but- What kind of different jobs did you get on?
When you were a brick layer.
No, what kind of things did you do?
What kind of things did you build?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
You had to go around on your own?
You didn't work for one company?
Hm.
Mm.
I see.
Were you in union or anything?
Mm.
You didn't join a union.
Okay, here's a question that's going to test your imagination.
Suppose someone were to give you all the money you ever wanted in the world.
What would you do with it?
Have you ever thought about that?
Hm.
Do you know you would do it?
How you-  Would you give it an organization?
Mm-hm.
Do you have any in particular in mind?
Mm-hm.
Okay, suppose you could give  hundreds of thousands of dollars to  the needy and still had  a hundred thousand left over for yourself,  what would you do?
You wouldn't keep any.
Oh.
S- How can anybody ever make it?
On that.
Mm-hm.
Yes, I did.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, that's right.
Unintelligible Uh-huh.
What about your job here?
What do you do in a day's work?
Hm.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
How do you issue?
Do you- Mm-hm.
You don't have to carry it or put it on a truck.
Right .
What kind of supplies mostly?
Office?
Mm-hm.
There's that many.
Yeah, well,  I guess it doesn't su-  s-  Um,  how did- do you celebrate Christmas?
How did you?
Or Thanksgiving.
Mm-hm.
When you used to go  to North Carolina,  uh,  what did you do to celebrate Christmas?
Did you have decorations?
What did you have to eat?
Mm-hm.
A real big feast.
How many people would be there?
Mm.
I guess there really was.
Do your remember the best Christmas present you ever got?
Oh yeah?
Uh,  what was it?
What did it look like?
Uh-huh.
How long did you keep it?
No kidding.
They really built 'em in those days.
??
Mm-hm.
Okay.
What did you do in the Army?
What branch were you in?
What did you have to do?
Hm.
Interesting.
That was during the war?
Did you go overseas?
You were lucky in a way.
Mm.
Were you ever in a situation where you thought you might be killed or you might die?
Either in the Service or somewhere else.
You never were in any danger or kind of serious?
Sometimes people say that what's evers gonna happen, it's gonna happen.
Do you agree with that?
You don't think there's any point in trying to  uh,  change the future?
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Is this  part of your religious faith?
It's just something you-
