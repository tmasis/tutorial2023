Great, so like I said, I'll just ask things about, uh, where you're growing up, what you're into and, you know, you can feel free to take it where you want.
Um, yeah, it's pretty open ended.
Uh,  yeah.
So, I usually start off though with questions about where you grew up.
So- and, you know, you're a born native here, right?
Okay.
Wow.
Mm-hm.
S- so, are you the first generation native to Rochester, or are your parents- Okay.

Family nearby, that's cool.
Um, how would you describe the neighborhood in terms of people, places maybe?
