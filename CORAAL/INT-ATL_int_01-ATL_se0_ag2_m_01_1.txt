Okay,  this is, um, another interview,  um,  from RD-NAME-3,  uh, for  Oregon State University  and  today I'm interviewing  RD-NAME-1.
Um, RD-NAME-1, what's your first  and last name?
RD-NAME-5.
Okay, cool.
Now this gonna be a-  a kind of different  type of interview.
It's gonna be a lot of free styling, but I got in mind  how I  wanna conceptually wrap this up.
We gonna be speaking for  briefly  forty-five minutes or so.
Um,  but really it's just more  for them to get a understanding of your linguistics.
This the linguistics department, so they wanna I guess, understand how you  say your words and  all that different type of stuff.
So, you know,  just relax, be you, be normal.
We just gonna  continue our conversation, and, um, I'll just keep you posted with the check times, but, um, yeah.
Told me your name.
How old are you?
And I need like- you know,  I know that's not a long  drawn out type answers, but give me a couple of those when it- when it calls for it.
Forty, man.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Aw, man.
Yeah.
Oh my gosh.
Name and age, bruh I'm amazed.
Nah, that's- that's cool though.
That's cool.
I'm th- I think we're definitely gonna- we are already on five minutes, we are through that.
Ay, um, so how do you feel about turning forty?
Ooh.
That shit cool as fuck.
Oh, .
Oh, my god.
That's exactly what it is man.
Oh man,  it's a spaceship.
Mm.
Kind of like how we talking about the cells.
It's somebody talking about us like that.
Oh, my gosh that probably look like the coolest shit, oh.
Being deprived of that for so many years and then being able to see that shit.
Hold on, time out.
So do you feel like the equivalant of us like  jumping out of a fish tank, we would just be flapping on the ground of the floor, o- of the fish tank or some shit.
I mean, I'm- I mean, I'm- I'm saying the- the goldfish or whatever is-  is truly free when they're out of the fish tank.
But if they're in the real world, and they're just a-  or if they're in the, you know, world for that example,  and they just flopping around, what they-  what is the-  just gonna die?
Or they just gonna- nothing's gonna happen?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Oh yeah.
Oh, okay.
Hoo, okay.
Ah, okay.
Mm.
So really you feel like it's the inner thing that-  that change you or makes you more or whatever, than the outer, I guess things.
But the outer circumstance do play a big part in it,  you know,  of course.
But truly, you know, if it was,  you know, just focused on that, it would be no problem.
Okay.
Oh yeah?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Damn.
I remember you saying that and, um try not to be indecisive.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Oh my gosh.
Ah, hurry hurry, you're the worst.
Mm.
Know what that's kind of reminding me of?
I seen a movie, um,  the other day.
Dang, I can't even remember the name of it,  but it was in theaters right n-  right now.
And they're- they're on the plane.
I mean, they're on the s- sh- ship, and it's  two of them woke up before the time  they was supposed to get to the  planet, and it's like  six thousand years in the future.
Yeah, it's already out, right now.
Ah, I want to say something like the blavity or something, but it might not be that.
It might be something else,  the ship.
I'm'a- I'm'a actually look it up right now, but,  um,  it's pretty cool, like, I like the graphics or whatever.
But, um,  yeah, they-  they on a-  they- I guess they found another earth  with the same type of atmosphere  as ours, so they was gonna go there, you know, colonize it, do what they do, whatever.
But they had like, I guess, six thousand of some of the brightest people on earth.
And they was gonna send them off,  you know, to do,  you know, whatever.
It's gonna take six thousand years for the next  set of people to come up there.
Mm.
Oh my gosh, for just somebody gonna pick that shit up  Mm-hm.
What do you think your cells is doing when it's completely cold like that?
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, for real?
That's what that s- stood for?
Wha- um,  I guess, it look,  you know, crystal,  I guess.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, true, true.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh man.
It gotta be pure.
Oh okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
What if you just standing there, and you not with all that shit?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Oh shit.
Yeah.
That's the real thing of everything.
Oh the thing with the ship though,  they built it to be an ish-  indestructible ship.
But, um,  I guess somewhere in they calculations,  they didn't plan for a big ass meteorite to just come slap that shit.
Slap the fuck out that bitch, but it destroyed.
So that shit still rolling around pretty much impenetrable or whatever.
But  shit malfunctioning now Six thousand people still asleep.
You know,  ain't nobody gonna survive being on that ship for six thousand years just to make it to that other planet.
You can't turn back around  It's gonna take you like  three hundred,  um, years to get back home and shit like that, or  you was probably like halfway out or some shit.
Over with for your ass.
So they going around throughout this ship,  after they realize,  cause they ain't realize til much later on that the ship was actually fucked up.
That's the reason they was out in the first place.
And then, um,  they actually had to fix the  ship or at least try to.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah.
It's impossible.
You gonna have no where to start either.
Woah.
Okay.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
That's true.
Dang.

Bear-  bear's grease was a popular treatment for men with hair loss from at least as early as sixteen fifty-three until about the first war.
The myth of it's effectiveness  is based on belief that as  bears  are very hairy that would assess hair growth  in others.
The English- blah blah blah.
mystic-  Oh, they got- they got-  yeah, they got the Native American use Use of bear's grease among their Native Americans on the hair to make it shinier was widespread.
Other s- popular substance included dear marrow  and raccoon fat.
In the Northeast tribes of the Sauk, Huron and Delaware, the daily use  of bear grease on their hair  was popular among both men and women.
Men in the Dakota Sioux and cow tribes also regularly used bear's grease.
