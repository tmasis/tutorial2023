The questions are pretty open ende-  uh, feel free, you know, if you wanna go off on tangents, tell a story, that's fine.
No right or wrong answers here, just your perspective.
Um, if you see me  peek down, you don't have to stop talking.
It's just me making sure that,  um,  my-  sorry,  the wrong thing out-  just making sure that my, um,  recorder is still going, the tape is still going.
So,  okay, great.
Um, so I usually start off with questions about,  um,  where you grow up- grew up in Rochester or what neighborhood were you born in.
So, um, yeah.
Where'd you grow up?
Mm-hm.
Oh, wow.
I- wow.
That's crazy.
A whole neighborhood.
Okay, and what was y-  uh, the neighborhood like when you were coming up?
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
And what schools did you go to?
Okay.
And, uh,  maybe we can zoom in on the high school experience.
How was RD-SCHOOL-2 for you?
Mm-hm.
And what kinds of like activities were you into?
Like did you do sports, or,  um, you know, like  any clubs?
Yeah.
So what made your grandmother, um, did she-  was she born in Rochester, or did she migrate here from  somewhere else?
Mm.
Yeah, I w- I wanted to talk about that a little more.
I feel like Rochester is a place where, you know, a lot of black folks, we got connections to the South.
Um, so  do you find yourself  visiting frequently, or- Yeah.
And so, do you see yourself,  uh, maybe moving back down there cause there's also a lot of people who are migrating back south.
Are you thinking of that, or-  Okay.
Mm.
And does, uh, your husband like have some of the language of- yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
It's cool.
Okay.
So I- I  wanna backtrack for a little bit.
Um,  after high school, uh, what was the next big step for you?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And  what made you decide to go back to school?
Like,  why not continue, I guess, doing hair, or- Okay.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
And  when you continued school, d- were all the schools located in Rochester?
Or did you leave?
Right.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
Um, I'm curious to know, what was your experience like at RD-SCHOOL-3?
Did you like it?
I went there for undergrad, so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so, not having that support, at least from them, did you feel like, uh,  there was other support within the community maybe, in terms of a writing circle or, uh, mentors?
Mm-hm.
Okay, so you're a professor now.
What are your favorite courses to teach?
Woof.
Oh cool.
Very cool.
Okay.
What would you say are some of the most challenging aspects  of, um, being an educator,  um, at RD-SCHOOL-3?
Mm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um, I wanted to ask a question about your writing.
Um, and just- sorry,  I got scared for a second looking down.
I wanted to ask about your own writing and, uh,  I guess, uh, what inspires you?
Mm-hm.
And how would you ecs- assess I guess the creative writing community here in Rochester?
Mm-hm.
Nah, I share that same sentiment.
I mean, I  don't write as much anymore but I was a creative writing major at RD-SCHOOL-2.
So.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
Two thousand eight.
I probably would know him by face.
But yeah, nah.
I share the same sentiment.
I'm all about like,  you gotta read the greats, and  learn different techniques and skills and- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
That was one of the greatest  lessons though that RD-SCHOOL-2 taught me, so.
Yeah.
Yes, for sure.
Um,  so  I wanna move more into questions, I guess, more Rochester related.
Um,  let's see where should I start?
Okay, well what are some of your favorite aspects of Rochester?
Mm.
I like the way you put that.
Um, so  what are some of the major changes, I guess in your lifetime, you feel like the city has gone through?
Mm.
I know.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-mm.
I mean just looking at the graduation rates, it's just like- Yeah  Okay.
Uh, I don't wanna- I know you hate this word diversity, but I'm curious to know-  whether or not you, uh perceive Rochester to be a demographically diverse place?
Yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
Um, so  my next  couple questions I guess are more language related, and um,  yeah.
So I always ask whether or not  you perceive or have been told by someone else that you have a  Rochesterian accent.
Mm-hm.
And who do you hear it among?
Is like younger folks, older- like- Yeah, tha- yeah, that's been something that I've been hearing.
Folks that are like, uh, no, literally sound like though.
But I get this, um,  Southern thing a lot in interviews, and so I just wonder like what, you know, infuences maybe on the way we pronounce things, you know.
Uh, that has had from our- yeah, our ancestors.
So  yeah.
I always like to ask, and yeah so the people who tell you you're from New York though are, uh, folks  who- if you go down south.
But the people who tell you you're- you sound Southern are folks- Yeah, okay.
Isn't that interesting?
Mm-hm.
Right.
Yeah.
Well, um,   those are all the questions I have, but  do you have any maybe last thoughts or comments about Rochester, your experiences here?
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
And, um, do you still consent to me using the interview?
Okay, I always have to  it.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
