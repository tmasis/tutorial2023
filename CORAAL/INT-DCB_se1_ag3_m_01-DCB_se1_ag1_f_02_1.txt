Or some- well, Maryland and DC kind of got the same slang.
So most of you- we know because  when we in Maryland,  it's like the same but a little different.
A little different?
Yeah.
It's a little different how people act or how people talk and act?
Yeah, DC- More aggressive?
Yeah.
And most- And we you know- we could go outside and play basketball in DC,  but you can't do that cause most of the time it's a lot of dudes sitting around a lot of- a lot of corners and-  and s- they also be trying to rob you s- if they see you with a fresh pair of shoes or something like that.
Yeah.
That's   And what are the- what- what are the, um, like-  like what is it that you- so you moved from Maryland to DC, what is it that you miss  from Maryland  that they don't- that- that  they don't have here in DC, or whatever the case may be?
And what is it that you love about DC?
Only thing I love about DC is  mm.
Let's see.
Going to school and getting my education, most likely.
Getting your education?
So the school system's pretty different in- like in Maryland?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
How?
Well the grading system like,  uh, it's-  a D- well- well,  most likely like a D  would have to be like a sixty three.
And in Maryland a D is a sixty.
So you take three points off Wow.
from the D.
Oh okay, okay.
Well any grade.
So like, with- with DC like, what is like-  do you-  like has your family traditions changed since you moved from Maryland to DC?
No not really.

School system?
Yeah.
Like if you y- like of your friends-  are y'all still friends with like the friends y'all had over in M-  in Maryland?
Mm-hm.
Yes.
That you- are y'all- did any of you meet new friends here?
Mm-hm.
Is that difficult?
How difficult is that?
It's not-  Yeah like when we wanna be around more successful people who want be- who wanna  encourage you to do  what you wanna do  and not bring you down.
Mm-hm.
And then that's when you come across, you know, people who-  people who um-  Y'all doing good too.
And that's when you come across people who, um,  you know, who-  when you're not from around, you know, they didn't see you and you like kind of new or whatever that's when they-  you gotta deal with all the nonsense, right?
Pretty much?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Have you ever got in a altercation  in DC?
Mm-hm.
Did you have to-  you know, was it- what happened?
We-  we was coming from Gallery  and, uh,  these two girls had saw y- saw this girl named RD-NAME-2 that was with us,  and then s- some boys was with them and they was about to fight RD-NAME-2.
and one of 'em, uh, one of the boys was  talking about me to his friend.
And  they said what hood I claim, I said I don't claim a hood.
And then,  uh, they tried- they try to fight me so I walked off.
Well, me and RD-NAME-2 walked off,  then they followed us.
One tried- one tried to throw a punch and I slipped and  they both took- one of 'em took my shoe.
Oh wow, that's- that's messed up, man.
Is that like- that's what they do you know, I mean actually that's what bullies do though they try to take advantage and think they getting over, but, Yeah.
Mm.
yeah that's crazy man.
So let me aks you this, is, um,  like-  does- you know, tell me about mumbo sauce.
What do you know about mumbo sauce, like if I'm from out of town I don't know like, somebody say mumbo sauce, what is mumbo sauce?
Mumbo sauce- Basically your chicken and fries, most likely.
But certain carry outs might be nasty you gotta go to certain ones.
And what do you think's in it?
Like, what's in it?
I think- I don't- I- it's probably is ketchup cause most likely it's probably is ketchup but- Yeah it's g- it's pretty good though.
Pretty good?
You like it RD-NAME-1?
Mm-hm.
RD-NAME-1 say, mm-hm.
What other foods like, is- is there any other thing that- that-  any food wise that y- that's DC like, when you- you know you say it, like mumbo sauce?
What about go go?
I don't- Yeah, what about- what do y'all know about go go?
Like when d- when-  tell me the  youngest age you- you ex- you've ever experienced it and heard it or whatever the case may be.
I'd probably say- Nah, I say like around like s- seven or eight cause RD-NAME-3 would- Is it different?
Like, what is go- like if someone was aksing you what is go go, what is it?
Me, I-  pecifically I don't really know cause I don't like go go all like that to- to me.
It's just so much noise and  too much for no reason.
But still just same beats you hear it's like  that every go go song has to me.
So you think there's like, no- is there any difference in like the bands or whatever to you?
S-  so um,  what about, you know like-  what do y'all think of like at your age like what do y'all think of like  as far as like going to college and like, what do you- how do you see your future  playing out?
Go ahead, go ahead.
In college I see me playing basketball and football.
Cause I really want to be a football player but if I can't make it to football I really wanna be a basketball player.
So really, I hope I could make it in the NFL  and be real- really successful and share my  life with  other little kids when I get older.
To me,  I see myself in college playing football cause  I like to play football  and it's more  action  to me.
Okay what do y'all like-  like what is it that you- that you're doing now to-  to  make that happen?
Like make your dreams- like what- what steps are- are you taking or you could be taking to make that a possibility?
Stay focused in school,  don't be a- Get all my work done.
don't be around a lot of people that gonna bring me down or talk about me.
And  just  even if they talk about me, prove-  just  stay focused and  just work out and  be successful  in everything you do, don't- never give up on something.
Mm-hm.
Amen to that.
What is like- what do you think is like the biggest problem with the school system?
Well- Like what do like- what would y'all change like, what would y'all like to be like, okay if you change this it would be a lot better?
You said Michelle Obama make you eat healthy?
Well I say that too though cause either way- But-  But either way my opinion about it, she shouldn't have changed it cause either- either- either way in school even if you eat healthy when they go home they gonna eat whatever they wanna go and eat.
So you-  Yeah so it's- it's- some people not- they not gonna care about  eating in school cause they know they gonna go home and eat what they want.
So it's not gonna really change nothing cause you only eat  breakfast and lunch in school so it's really not gonna make you skinnier or fatter.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
What about- what m- what-  what would make school safer?
Like what could  be done to make school safer for  any student, any nationality do- they can dress the way they wanna dress, they can do- you know what I mean?
What do you think would make school safer?
I mean that's hard.
Yeah.
To be honest, I don't know.
I don't really think school gonna be  any safer because  it's still gonna be hood- hood gangs cause  people coming up nowadays they g- they gonna  get it from they dad or get it from the people that surround 'em.
So I don't know if school really gonna be safe for other kids growing up nowadays.
So are y'all like, uh- so your- you two are in high school, correct?
Mm-hm.
And you're in what?
Elementary.
Middle school.
You're in- you're in middle school?
He said elementary.
So you're in middle school, so y'all- like do you go through some of the same stuff that-  that they've experienced?
Not really.
Not really?
But do you understand like, that's a possibility as you move forward and how to deal with it?
Yeah.
That's what's up.
So what about like-  what about like- do teachers like help y'all- like are teachers  really good?
I mean you have a like- who's your favorite teacher?
You don't-   I'm with her on that one too I really don't have no favorite teachers but  either way you-  either y- way I don't have no favorite teacher I just stay focused and make sure I do all my work  and get good grades.
To me it's not about having a favorite teacher, or-  to me it's about  getting your-  g- getting your work done, getting your grades done, doing an- any- any and everything  to get you to the next grade or get you  to that step forward in life.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
It's like, how do you learn like-  w- how do you  retain information?
Like do you r- if you read something  do you get it just like that or someone has to say it to you then you understand it?
Mo- yeah, most of the time- Well me personally,  I just thank RD-NAME-2 because if it weren't for RD-NAME-2 helping me  and showing me steps, steps and steps,  I don't think I could do it without RD-NAME-2.
To be honest.
That's what's up, man.
What about you, man?
Me, I  j- use my notes  and  if I don't understand something I aks the teacher,  uh, help me  better understand the  thing that I'm  need help with.
Oh okay.
So let me ask you this then, what's your, um- like what are places that-  have you guys traveled a lot?
Like what- where are other places have y'all- have y'all been to?
Philly.
How was that?
How was that experience in Dallas?
And you say you've been to Dallas and where else?
Philly, Florida, Ocean City.
Virginia, all that.
Wow, that's awesome.
How- now y- how do y'all like- y'all like going to see y'all sister do that?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
But on some- most of the time we don't go because  RD-NAME-2, Mom and RD-NAME-2 be the only one who go because they got the money to  get down and they don't wanna waste a lot of money  for all of us to go down Dallas or Philadelphia something like that.
So,  I l- I love to support my sister but  only thing I hate is  that  s- some  some  people  like in her basketball game,  I don't like watching  them just give up.
Well not RD-NAME-2 but  other people like give up cause  most of the teams they play they not really that good.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.
So what about like-  you know y'all have a dog.
He's aggressive.
But he's, uh-  How's that experience like how did y'all-  how long you had your dog?
We had a dog for a long time, it been like- like t- ten, twelve years probably.
Been a long time.
What do you love about your dog?
Like was you excited when y'all first got him?
Yeah.
Did y'all know?
Was it a surprise?
Well yeah it was a- It was very surprising- yeah it was very surprising cause he came out of nowhere he had the little dog.
And that's m- that's my little homie because  he's chill with me.
Also cry to me to take him outside.
And  he just,  if I'm asleep,  lay beside me, things like that.
Man, what's like- what's the  what's the- like the greatest thing about having a dog?
Like does sometimes- like if you by yourself and you down or something like does he come and save the day sometimes?
It's- sometime- well for me   sometimes I- when I'm in the house by myself sometime- cause I've- I- sometimes I think  if-  if somebody probably come in here Remy the first one to get me to know that somebody come in here cause when he  bark  maybe- it maybe- Yeah he alert me to hide or  be- get s- get somewhere safe.
Mm-hm.
What about you?
What do you like about your dog?
I like about him cause he smart he not  a big dog  like uh, a lot of dogs and  he really don't bite.
You can tell he really don't bite.
Yeah so that was interesting you said feel safe, so you like- around here do you,  you know, where you live at do you feel safe?
You said no?
Why is that?
Oh.
Yeah I understand that.
Well,  yeah, that too cause sometimes  walking up here by m- by ourself  feel like it's unsafe because somebody could just-  specially I don't- well I don't like- reason why I don't like this neighborhood because, like  we mostly got like a lot of  designer t- desi-  designer clothes and stuff like that.
Well not designer clothes but clothes that  a lot of people like wearing  like Helly Hansen and all that type stuff and  and when they see it they might try to rob us or something like that, that's why I don't really feel safe  catching the train or walking home by myself.
Mm, I understand.
So do y'all think like-  you think eventually- you know, eventually do y'all hope that y'all end up moving back to Maryland or Virginia or somewhere?
Yes.
Yeah.
than that.
Yeah reason why I like move- I like Maryland better cause  most of- it's like, we could go outside and play basketball  and we don't have to have no problems with nobody  around us doing something dumb.
Alright.
What about like-  what about-  you know, what do you-  RD-NAME-1 what do you love about your brother?
That he  help me  with  stuff.
He play sports with me,  we play games together,  and he give me that  like  some of his old shoes that he can't fit anymore.
Oh that's tight.
What do you love about your sister?
I love m- I love my sister very hard, I love that she help me in school,  she cares about me,  she really love me and  she just- ev- even when sometimes when I feel like I don't wanna do the-  do the work no more she still push me to that  limit to do the work even if I get mad at her, she still help me.
What about you, what do you love about  RD-NAME-3?
Hey that's awesome.
That's awesome.
What does um-  what does on fleek mean?
So use it in a sentence.
RD-NAME-1 you use it in a sentence, RD-NAME-1.
Um,   let me see.
Your shoes is on fleek.
Your shoes is on fleek.
So that means your shoes are tight?
Oh.
Mostly girls.
Oh girls say on fleek?
Yeah.
Oh I never- see that's the first time, I never knew that.
Oh I didn't know that, see I really learned something today, I didn't know that.
What are other words like, what is lunching?
What's that?
Lunching-  Cause it can ap- it can be applied to anything?
Yeah, yeah.
Or like you see somebody tripping out  in, uh,  middle of the street or something  cause they off a drug or something, they tripping or they lunching.

Play sports.
I like to play the game,  play sports, play with my brothers and sister  and  just  have fun chilling with them I see you have video games in here and uh-   So what games y'all like to play?
My favorite game to play is two K sixteen,  well,  two K.
Cause Madden, it's not like two K because Madden don't have all that my career  and things like that and  that's  really gonna hype me up to play that game.
Mm-hm, what about you, RD-NAME-1?
I guess,  go with  two K sixteen too.
Cause it's more fun.
Like Madden  it really don't have a purpose of playing it  for like a  long time or something.
You like Madden?
So do y'all like compete against each other in the games or y'all usually play together?
Yes.
Most- most likely I like to play with my brother.
And- cause  I don't- I just like  love playing with my brother.
Even though we have our ups and downs.
Oh, okay.
What's a game that all of- all three of y'all ever competed against each other at?
Uh- And uh, what was that game called?
Uh, the boxing game on the Wii.
Uh, what else?
It was that, um,  game we had on the three sixty.
Crash Course.
Yeah Crash Course.
Crash Course?
Who was the best?
You don't remember that game?
Oh whatever.
Three point contest?
Who- did y'all have to pick a favorite player or something?
No we just pick whoever we like.
Oh yeah slam dunk contest I remember that when RD-NAME-2 and RD-NAME-3 beat me in uh, RD-NAME-1 remember?
So you- so you play basketball right?
Oh so- so when you was naming all them places that's where you played basketball at?
Oh you cheered there oh okay, okay, I just wanted to get a understanding  okay.
Alright.
So like what do y'all like-  like,  what's-  what makes you you?
You know what I mean?
Like, what makes you you?
Uh, what ma- what makes me me?
I say what makes me me is my dad most likely cause when I see-  what I see him do  and how he treat my mom  it- it- it's-  it make me  wanna be like my dad  and be a-  be a man like him  when I get older.
And I'm a chill- chill person,  I don't- I don't like to fight.
I like to be cool with a lot of people.
And who gonna-  And  my little brother make me me too because-  well all- both of 'em make them me be- make me  me because  they really-  they really mean something to me in my life.
What makes me me is  uh,  playing football cause that's something I like to do.
Like I like  playing with my  brothers and sister cause  they, uh- we always have fun.
Like,  meet new people.
I like to uh,  be cool with everybody  and like stay to myself sometimes.
And don't start any drama.
Don't start any drama?
So how do like- how do y'all view the world?
Like from your perspective on like- from what you see, the images on TV or whatever,  like how do you view the world, how do you see the world?
What about you?
Uh, I see the world as,  as hate- uh, hatred too because  they- when they see somebody with fancy clothes, fancy cars, they gonna  try to take it  and rob you.
And what make me mad about that because they don't try to  go out there and get it theirself and  work hard for it.
What about you?
I say the world is crazy cause  we got people killing each other,  people robbing each other, stealing from each other, fighting,  and  yeah.
Stealing from each other and fighting, yeah you right about that.
How do you see like- like, how do you see-  like as a young  black female, how do you see your- how do you-  do you-  how do you feel like when you're out and about?
Like  do you- Do you feel like you get treated differently  because like, you're female or whatever the case may be?
Or- or do you feel like you get treated differently because you're a black female?
You never experienced racism before?
You?
Me neither, I really didn't experience, uh, racism neither.
Yeah.
And you?
Me neither.
What does racism mean to you?
You consider the police a higher person?
Mm-hm yeah I understand what you're saying.
What about you?
Uh,  hm.
Well like,  how can I say this?
Uh, I guess that  racism is like,  how  Trayvon Martin got killed just cause he had a hoodie on  and  just cause he was black, he d- thought he was tryna rob someone for no reason.
Just cause he had a hoodie on.
And  I guess  like  but when a police officer pulled over a black person just beat 'em up for no reason.
What about you?
I say racim i- racism is like  a person  like a different color from  the, uh, that person  say that like they're-  that like they're uh, yeah.
A  black-  like just start calling them names,  and all that.
How did y'all feel like when y'all-  did y'all know like the big deal behind Barack Obama  being elected president?
Did y'all know it was a b- like when did you know it was a big deal?
What about you?
Uh, same thing like RD-NAME-2 said,  but  I- it- to me I thought,  well,  Obama I think he did help u- help us.
you think he helped us   What about you RD-NAME-1?
I say  that he did help  f- some people.
Well like mostly  s- people that h- he helped them succeed  in life.
Yeah.
So what, um,  like-  where are the places that all of y'all been  together?
What's the difference between Virginia Beach and Ocean City is it- one's better or are they both pretty much the same?
Florida?
Why was Florida the best?
We s-  We seen our family.
You had a cook out?
What about  like,  have y'all ever been to a game all y'all together?
Like been to s- What team y'all went and saw together?
A Wizards- y'all like the Wizards?
Yeah.
Tell me about the Wizards, why- if I'm a fa- if I'm not a Wizards fan, I don't know nothing about basketball or nothing, tell me why I should be a Wizards fan.
I think you should be a Wizard fan because  to me,  I think they are- they could be a best-  the best team in the world it just  they- they need another small forward to help them out.
And like, I hope when KD becomes a  free agency  I hope he comes to the, uh, DC  so he could help us out.
Because we don't really have  a experienced small forward that really could take us to the championship.
Um, yeah.
No Otto  Oh my god.
What about you?
Why should I- you don't like the Wizards?
Yeah.
Why should I- why should somebody be a Wizards fan?
Cause everything they saying pretty much?
Cause- Yeah.
Yeah.
So, okay.
So d- how was that experience though, when y'all went to the game?
It was- Yeah it was cool but I wish it was a better team though than Orlando Magics.
Cause I would wanna see them play harder.
What about- you just said earlier about KD to- KD to DC.
Kevin Durant, what do you know- what- how would that be if he came here, if he actually came here?
Uh,  that would be the best.
You said that would be the best?
Yeah.
Yeah he definitely will make this area a lot better.
Alright well,  I don't have any more questions.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
