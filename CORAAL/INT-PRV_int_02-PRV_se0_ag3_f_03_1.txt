we were back there by ourself.
Everybody had done gone and left us, all but Mr.
RD-NAME-1.
He came by the house and said everybody was nobody here .
No neighbors came by the house and said  get out or nothing.
And so thank the Lord that the helicopters flew around and saw- saw people down the hill.
And so we walked to Mr.
RD-NAME-1 house, me and my two kids and my husband and my mama,  and so she was in a wheel chair.
So- Oh my God.
She sure was, and so we  drove her over there to Mr.
RD-NAME-1 house.
Just- Uh-huh.

a whole lot of stuff.
Mm-hm.
It was already there.
Were you able to drive out?

Yes sir.
And did you say the helicopter came into- Yeah.
were you at Mr.
RD-NAME-1's house  hm?
Left us-  that  left us all that water  all the way up to my hip back there.
I was so afraid for my two kids.
My little boy he was screaming and hollering.
I thought he was gonna fall out into- jump out of the car- get far  jump out.
I was praying to the Lord he don't.
Oh my gosh, yeah.
Scared me to death.
And how did that-  I mean how did the helicopters find you?
They just  saw people?
Well know, that- that day, you know, the- the helicopter flew around all that day?
Mm-hm.
That's how they know that we was back there.
Oh, okay.
And so all us run up- my family went over to Mr.
RD-NAME-1 house.
Mm-hm.
And so we stayed there until about  at least about five o'clock when we hear the helicopters   that noise?
I thank the Lord.
Cause that water stuff was getting ready to come inside the house but none got in there.
Not .
Okay.
Can I interrupt you guys for a minute?
Absolutely, that's fine.
I'm just gonna uh-  Alright.

RD-NAME-1, he came to my home  and knocked on the door  and  told- and my husband went to the door.
And he said, everybody done gone away from back here.
And I said, what?
Ain't nobody came and evacuated us and told us to get out of the home or nothing.
And we didn't- if they did, we didn't hear them.
They didn't tell us nothing.
And so, we- I got scared.
And so I went back there in the room where my mama was at,  I said, ma, I said,  Lord.
Everybody- I c- I can't believe everybody left elected him.
I said Mr.
RD-NAME-1 the only one stood by him.
They- they uh- they let us know that everybody was gone.
And his family already had done left him, so he stayed back for the-  the- know it- let everybody else know that was left back there  know what was going on.
And so  we went on ba- we went on- so he went on back to the house.
And so we went on  and got ourselves together and walked over there Mr.
RD-NAME-1 house  And so  uh, some more people came up  and they hadn't left.
And so we stood there together, everybody- the helicopter kept flying around before we left  and see that we was back there.
I said well maybe they'll come and get us.
And about  that water st- it wa- started walking around then the water was started  coming and doing.
I said, Lord have mercy.
I hope that  these folks would come and get us.
And about five o'clock that morning-   By five o'clock that morning we had a helicopter   that noise I said th- they gave us a ride there up out of here.
So the helicopter out- lift us out of the- out of the- out- out of this water,  and the water was right up- up on my hip, and it was right cold and so I was sc- well he got my two- he got my two k- kids first.
And um,  got them up out of there,  and I was afraid for my boy cause he was hollering and screaming.
I thought he was gonna f- jump out there, that basket.
And I prayed to the Lord that he don't  and God know he didn't.
And so  they come back and got me,  and so we- and they lift me up, and then they came and got my husband, RD-NAME-1,  and lift him up.
And then  I said, what about my mama?
She in a wheelchair.
I said, what-  I said, I know they ain't gonna let her stay back there.
And so- and we got us at Tarboro High School and so I kept walking around, looking for the helicopter bring my mother.
And so by the day about seven o'clock,  that evening-  that morning,  then I saw the uh- the rescue squad.
I said,  that's RD-NAME-5 in that rescue squad.
And then I  f- I heard- I said maybe that's my mama.
And I ran- me and my husband ran over there and saw her.
She was there screaming and hollering.

I didn't know what to do.
I thought y'all had just got  grounded.
I said, no Ma.

And um, how did the rebuilding of- of Princeville after the flood?
How did- how did things start coming back together?

That's so kind.
It sure was.
Yes.
Yeah, they were doing that, giving away spoons and pots and uh, clothes, they'll give you, uh, voucher and bags of stuff, you know.
Back when you get in your home you could u-  replace your stuff that you had,  majority of most- most of your stuff that you had.
And that was good.
Red Cross was good too.
Everybody was good.
They sure did.

It was a lot of people was out there helping- helping us out.
And I thank the Lord for 'em.

Well I think one of the most amazing things is when we hear about this, you know, how close the town is, I mean do you think like,  people you know, here in Princeville grew closer  through the process of rebuilding together?
That's sad.
After- even after everything.
