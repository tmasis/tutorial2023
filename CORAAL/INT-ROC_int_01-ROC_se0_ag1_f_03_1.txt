Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Okay,  cool.
Um,  so I guess I wanna turn to asking a few more questions about  your thoughts on Rochester.
Like,  um,  what do you feel like are the best aspects of Rochester, or- and what  do you think could use improvement I guess?
If there are any best for you .
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
It is.
Mm, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Listen.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
And where do you think those people I guess live  uh generally?
Who- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
That's great.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
And so, I wanna ask you this question cause I've gotten it several times,  when I was an undergrad, people asked me, they were like, is Rochester segregated?
And I'm like,  for me I didn't really realize it, cause I just  grew up in it.
But do you feel like it's segregated?
or do you feel like it's kind of diverse or there are pockets of  Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
Um,    And I guess my last question would be,  do you feel like, um, people in Rochester, in all your travels I guess, do you feel like people in Rochester have an accent?
And they speak a certain way?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Ah, you have to send me that.
I just wanna see what it looks like.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Corn Hill .
Mm-hm.
Hm.
I'm actually trying to figure out what it is to have a Rochester  accent.
So I'm not even quite sure what it is.
I mean people say it's like you say things like Rochester .
And I'm like, okay.
But you know, that's part of what I'm investigating.
It's what I'm,  trying to say.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah like that.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
And so,  uh- oh do you mean like, Chili and stuff like that, or- Hm.
Mm-hm, yeah.
Yep.
I feel like if some- like if I did a perception experiment.
And like, put your voice up there, I don't think that people would automatically just be like, she's from Rochester, you know.
I don't think people like that would.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
See ya.
Huh?
Yeah, I'll be back tomorrow.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.

Well, we'll see.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know.
Okay, well.
Um, okay,  do you have any questions for me and are you okay with me possibly using this recording  for research purposes?
Yeah, okay.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah- yeah putting stress on the first accent.
Yeah.
I mean the first syllable, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Hey.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My job's good.
I don't know.
Like, I guess I feel like I don't have the same day everyday.
So, I like that about it.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
For me that's important.
Some people like  the tradition.
And you know, d- daily routine.
But I like being able to learn through things and  yeah.
Have a different experience  everyday.
So- Yeah thank you, appreciate it.
This has been fun.
No you're fine.
