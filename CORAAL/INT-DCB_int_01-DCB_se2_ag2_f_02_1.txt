I know I just talked to him, but-  Um, and what does your mom do?
Cool.
Alright, so I'll type all that up.
So,  as much as you can remember, I want you to tell me a little bit about  growing up  um,  Woodland Terrace.
Um,  if you can remember your house, your siblings, your family.
Most definitely.
I mean you tell me what you want.
The whole point is about telling stories, kind of your experience, and it's actually great that you moved out- And kind of what you remember, what stuck out to you, so that's- that's actually- I'm really excited to hear that part too.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.

Mm.
Hm.
Mm, most definitely.
Actually advanced.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
What's your favorite subject?
Like in school, what do y- what do you remember like,  being  like, oh I love to go to this class.
Hm.
He didn't.
Y'all had a lot going on.
Mm-hm.
What was your favorite book?
Mm?
Mm.
I just couldn't-  I couldn't get into it past like,  the second one,  but I need to give it another chance.
I need to go back.
I did.
But I wasn't even a fan of the- I mean the first movie was great.
The second one, I was like, alright I'm- This is not- Messed it up?
No, I only read the first one.
Okay.
I'm'a give it a go again.
I really am cause I- I wanna get into it.
I love reading, but it didn't work out for me.
Okay.
So then you graduated from c- high school.
How- Wait.
For- Before you even go there, how did you get  from  your high school, how did you decide to go to RD-SCHOOL-2?
What number are you?
You se- Okay.
Okay.
Hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
What do you think was the- I- I'm sorry, just to keep going back to that one, um, but what do you think was the- If you can think about kind of your experiences while at RD-SCHOOL-2, and you said it was  you know, you had your issues with racism.
What do you feel like was that moment that you're like, oh my God.
I can't believe that really just happened.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Wow.
That it's still happening in whatever- what- two thousand some- two thousand- not too long ago.
Yeah.
So  going back and I- You may not even think-    I don't know if you remember cause you were quite young,  but thinking about your time in DC, and actually as you go back with your-  um, when you were going back to visit your grandmother,  that time.
Then when you moved to Virginia,  um, Woodbridge, and then when you went to RD-SCHOOL-2,  do you feel like, at different points you saw racism,  and do you feel like you saw it differently?
And how- how did it kind of manifest itself in each of those environ- well, RD-SCHOOL-2, we know but in the other two?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
And you're eight.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Is your mother fair skinned?
Mm.
Cause my mom's really fa- Like, my mom looks white.
So, and I'm- But my dad's like- is African, so  it- I can understand where I but- Because you're fair sk- Like, fair skin.
Mm-hm.
All different colors.
Yeah.
I love that.
Mm.
Mm.
So, let me go back.
Cause you talked about playing, and that-  Because I- Race, we could talk about all day.
Um, cause I think it's just so fascinating- Especially like,  so I'm not from DC.
I'm from Georgia,  so  race is a- a-  And then I had a bad incident with a police officer yesterday.
Um,  and so it's just like, really on my mind, but I don't want us to focus just on that.
But  when you talked about  playing, like as kids- So  you and your  two brothers are close in age?
Or relatively?
Oh.
Okay.
So what did y'all do- what did y'all do as like, kids?
Like, what kind of game- do you remember like, playing on the stoop?
With the penny candy?
Mm-hm.
Hm.
Cause you were kids, and that's what we do- They do s- Kids are the weirdest little creatures.
Mm-hm.
And now, everything is- You can't even walk outside.
Like Southeast is-  I mean you probably don't even remember- I don't know if you were aw-  Not that you don't remember, you may just not have been aware because you were eight,  six.
Um, but like turf wars.
Like, that's what your dad talked a lot about was the turf wars.
You do?
In D- Deanwood?
That is very much-  That's great.
Mm-hm.
Was it a turf thing?
Wow.
When was this?
Wow.
Yeah.
And it still- They still exist.
Um,  so I work at RD-WORK-4 too, and th-  there's one RD-WORK-1 in Southeast, and so  kids-  A lot of the neighborhood from both  turfs come to the RD-WORK-1,  but when they take kids home on this street,  the other kids have to duck down.
And when they go on the other street- It's just crazy.
Hm.
Yeah.
Yup.
.
Do you f-  Have you been- Okay.
So I remember coming to DC when I was a-  eleven,  and we went to the monuments and all the museums, but when it's in your back yard,  do you ever play tourist?
Have you ever played tourist?
Or is that like, oh, the-  the monuments and museums, they're right there.
I don't need to go to that.
Hm.
Did you-  Okay.
So going- Did you-  Did you talk to your grandmother a lot?
Do you remember her telling you stories?
What are your- some of your fondest like, memories of her storytelling?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Because she was lighter?
Hm.
I think that's what your dad said.
Yeah.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
I think that's what he said.
Mm-hm.
Wow.
And she-  Uh-  Did- She just passed a couple years ago- a few years ago right?
Mm-hm.
I remember your dad  was saying it was a few years ago.
Um, do you remember the story about  your mom's car?
Your mom's brand new car?
Um,   think it was a-  Was it an Escalade or something that got keyed up.
I don't know if you were in the car.
It may have been just your dad and your mom.
He didn't, so I didn't- He didn't- You know what?
He talks- He talked about your mom-  about-  Excuse me, about them meeting, but he didn't talk a lot about-   So that's an- Yeah.
First of all, you count- you crossing,  not only just neighborhoods, you're crossing qua- quadrants so- and wards.
So she's ward seven, Northeast.
That's ward eight, Southeast.
That's a whole lot.
That's a lot going on with that.
Oh, wow.
Huh.
So she was- Okay.
So,  okay, now I'm getting a whole different side, which is great because he kind of left out a lot of details.
He's like, yes,  I w- something about he was getting off the bus, and she was getting off the bus,  and he knew- Like, he didn't tell me the age difference,  and he knew that  um,  she was fine, and this was who he was gonna marry.
Um,  and so now to kind of hear some more, filling in some of the meat behind it.
Oh, okay.
Mm-hm.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Mother.
Getting both pieces, mm-hm.
Right.
Hm.
And did y'all live-  As far as you can remember, or what you've been told, did-  did y'all live with y'alls grandmother for awhile?
For a long time.
Okay.
And by then,  it was  three, not- It wasn't- Other- Your  youngest brother hadn't been born yet.
RD-NAME-2 hadn't.
Okay.
Right.
Okay, so but the other f-  the others of you are already born, so it was all of the- It was the grandkids, your mom and dad,  your grandma-  who else lived there?
So y'all had a house full.
Kind of like an 'L', 'V', 'L', kind of thing?
And so the one that's in the middle right there- Oh, okay.
So it didn't feel cramped.
It didn't feel like- Yeah, cause you're telling me all these people are in this one house.
Hm.
Hm.
And what changed?
So long.
Mm, yes.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Hm.
Right.
Now, DC, everybody's being pushed out  because it's so expensive.
Um,  do you feel like,  kind of on the outside looking in,  um-  continuing to go back.
Do you go into DC for any other reason?
Like do you just go in, like, to hang out with your friends,  um, or is it- Are you mostly like Northern Virginia kind of girl?
Hm.
Mm.
You- So you still have a lot of family live in DC.
Oh, what part?
They still live in Southeast?
Mm!
Mm-hm.
Oh, between the first three and the next set.
Mm-hm.
Hm.
That changes it.
Hm.
Hm.
Oh, okay.
And that's the one who just passed recently.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
I remember your dad was talking, but I didn't know who.
He didn't say names.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
If you could-  Do you think you'll ever like, go back?
Or you- Oh really?
Right.
Yeah.
Oh, most definitely.
I'm- I personally don't like public transportation, but  it is-  i-  for DC, it makes the most sen- I live in Southern Maryland now, so.
But DC, it makes the most sense.
Um, I went to RD-SCHOOL-2, so I know like I live- You know, I-  Well I was in the bubble.
I was mostly th- It's a bubble.
Trust, it's a bubble.
And so coming back here as an adult is so different.
Like my eyes are open.
I'm just like, this is nothing like you see on TV.
And they make it very much like, oh, it's this great-  I mean it's great.
Those-  But, it's real life outside of these six streets.
And it just blew my mind.
DC.
Mm-hm.
Maybe not even that long, but it's coming quickly.
Mm-hm.
And now it's just- it's so-  Can you talk about what you see?
Like how gentrification- how you feel like it's affecting-  Do you think it's a good thing, a bad thing?
Cause there's a very- You know, variety of opinions.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
It's become- Human trafficking is ridiculous.
Right.
You see the effects of the real life people, but you also see like, it could be a good thing.
Mm.
Mm.
Wow- oh.
Mm.
Yeah, you were in the bubble.
You were in the bubble.
Mm-hm.
That bubble will get you.
You had to pop it.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah, I- The- What I appreciate about your dad, was he was just really- His candor  about like, kind of the drug game, and how  like it just ran rampant through the neighborhood.
Like, you know, cause sometimes I know like, we're- It's a tape recorder, but  like,  I think sometimes we have to  talk about the reality.
Like, all of DC is not Capitol Hill.
Um- Even Capitol Hill is not even Capitol Hill in some cases.
But I think it's important to realize, just because that's where you  were, doesn't mean that's where you are, that's where you have to stay.
And I think that was really-  It was great kind of hearing his story  from the-  being in that lifestyle, and then moving and- and  really, you know, trying to better himself.
And I think that that's what-  those are the kinds of stories that just- I love to hear.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Right.
Mm-hm.
RD-NAME-2 I- I got to get you on my list too sir.
He is.
He worked at RD-WORK-4 like,  a long time in DC.
Talking me?
Uh-huh.
Aren't you from DC?
Yes.
Like you were born in DC.
Yes.
Mm-hm.
What neighborhood did you grow up in?
Southeast.
What part?
Brookland?
Woodland?
That's why you look familiar.
My aunt is RD-NAME-3.
I grew up in Woodland.
RD-ADDRESS-8.
See?
So RD-NAME-2, when am- when am- when am I gonna schedule you?
that's crazy.
Who's your dad?
He looked familiar, he smiled at me.
Like,  what's up?
He was at the dancing school.
Was he- I ain't know, you know, back in the day, you see somebody dancing in front,  old dude, you know about like,  okay, let me- let me go ahead.
Nah, I gotta go sell ducks.
Alright, go sell some ducks.
Call me next week.
Next week.
That's  No, seriously, yeah.
Next week will be good.
I'm serious, call me.
Let me know.
I- But call me.
Cause I- Monday I have a-  a meeting.
No, Monday I'll be at a conference.
Okay.
Good talking to you.
Okay, good.
I'll send you a email.
Alright.
Cool.
Alright I'm sorry,  but- I- I knew- only reason I knew he was from DC is because he used to work at RD-WORK-4 like fifteen, twenty years ago.
Like, in DC, and then he moved, and his family's here, all that.
Anyway,  so,  no, he-  he-  he was-  he went into- he talked about drugs, and he talked about  drinking, but he didn't really go into- Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yup, he does say- in fact he said- qu- um, you almost quoted him directly.
Yup.
Hm.
Yeah.
So your mom's what- forty-five-ish?
Somewhere thereabouts?
Forty- Mm-hm.
She always found a way to make- Mm.
Keeping up the appearances, yeah.
Um,  last thing cause I know- I know you all have some stuff to do, and I appreciate you taking the time- This is- this is great.
No, this is- And what I love is um,  being able to- it was great talking to your dad first,  um, because he was very much  a lot more general.
Um,  he elaborated on certain things, but other things he just totally skimmed over, and so then  for you- like some things, I- I- I've totally ac- actually forgot he said, and then for you to  fill in all those detail-  Great.
Absolutely wonderful.
Um,    three things.
One,  what's your favorite-  this is just crazy, but what's your favorite TV show or book?
And why?
Mm-hm.
Cause you had to be the older sibling even though you weren't the oldest.
Right.
Mm.
It's one of my faves.
Hm.
No, no, no.
Uh- but this is- This is great.
Um,  are you familiar with go go?
Oh!
Really?
Why?
I'm a fan of country music as well.
Why- um, do you have a favorite go go band or a song?
I have not but I'm'a make note to go listen to it.
Let me- let me write that on my- my notes.
I'm sorry.
Mm, mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
That's what he was just saying.
Did you um- Did you have any experience or do you have any experience from mumbo sauce?
Why?
Oh, you're talking about the group.
I was talking about the food.
But the group is great too.
Where- where do you get your- your f-  your best fried- your chicken wings and mumbo sau- Where do you get yours?
I think-  So you're off of- I think I do.
But up on the hill, are there like two big apartment- Like you go into a set of apartments on one side and there's another- I think I know where you're talking about.
Okay, well  s-  Um, when was the last time you had some mumbo sauce?
Hm.
Is- okay.
So now, let me ask you  cause I've gotten  a variety of  answers.
Now the carry out, is that different from like the Chinese  restaurant?
Or is that the same thing for you?
Mm-hm.
Okay, so-  Mm.
Mm-hm.
