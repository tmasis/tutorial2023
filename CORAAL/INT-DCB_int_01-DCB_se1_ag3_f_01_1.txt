And,  were you born and grew up in DC?
What neighborhoods?
Mm-hm.
Does it have a specific name- I don't really- It's that area.
Heights.
Oh, but Benning Heights is not that far down Okay, we'll call it Benning Heights, but you on the Northeast side, right?
You on the S-  You on the Southeast side.
Okay.
Oh, the other side.
Okay, so you're down by um, And it's a high rise.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh, okay.
No, I know because um, one of my friends lives, if you keep going down Southern, right where you cross the line?
There's like a Chinese restaurant or some rib place?
Yes, she lives right next door to that.
That- the apartment complex right there-  Mm-hm.
Okay so you up on this side?
So you're not very far from here at all.
What, like, five, ten- five minutes if that?
Um, alright.
And where'd you go to school?
Mm-hm.
I  used to tutor there.
Perfect.
And what do you do now?
Perfect .
And where your mother and father born here?
Hm.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
And what do they do?
Mm-hm.
Perfect.
How did-  How did you guys end up here?
Uh-oh.
It's sound like it's a story.
And that's what this whole thing is about.
When I ask you questions, and it makes you think of a story, please feel free to tell it.
Now, if it's true or not- Oh.
So he was in the Navy?
He was in the Army.
Oh, okay.
Oh.
Mm-mm.
I'm good, thank you I'm okay with that.
Um,  so do you remember your childhood home?
Oh, so this- Okay.
So tell me about that neighborhood and how have you seen that neighborhood change, like over the last twenty years or so?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh cause y'all were the- y'all were the kids And how many- How- How do you feel like as a ne- Are you s- guys still close knit, or do you feel like with  some of the newer people coming in, it's-  the neighborhood is- Right in.
Cool.
Mm-hm.
Why?
Do you- Do you feel like,  especially that neighborhood, because gentrification is happening all over DC, and it's starting to push its way over this way.
Do you feel like that is effecting your neighborhood?
Really?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Hm.
that's right  Why do you say that?
Because you know, it's interesting.
When I talk to people who are from Maryland, they're like, oh I'm from the DMV, you know.
We know DC.
And when I talk to people from DC, they're like, uh, no.
They are not real DC people.
How do you s- Why do you feel like it's different?
Like why is this your city?
Mm-hm.
And Atlanta's another chocolate-ish kind of city.
But it's a different feel.
Mm.
You said, I got to get back home.
So how did you end up back at your house?
Cause when you left to go to Atlanta, how'd you end up back?
And to see something different, do something different, and come back to the place you call home.
What's your best-  thinking about like, these block parties- I want you to tell me in- in as much detail as you can recall, like your best memory  of kind of your neighborhood,  probably when you were a little younger,  um,  and hanging out on the stoop, or hanging out or having a party, like give me some detail.
Mm.
What's the Senator?
I did not know that.
Cause I'm not from DC, so- I think so.
Mm-hm.
Oh, no, honey.
You can't even get a .
You can barely play pacman for a dollar.
Mm-hm.
Really?
And then- So then they closed before Safeway opened?
Mm, up this way?
Uh-huh.
By- pass the Denny's.
I don't know.
Go- keep going up.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Cause there's another People's- If you  go down like, New York and um-   Is it New York and P?
Or go passed P?
Like, go passed Flor- Like, toward Florida?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Wow.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
So this neighborhood has changed.
What do you- And do you foresee it changing it even more?
Like,  not even just like, the people, but I'm just saying like, as we continue to build.
Cause it seems like they started building in the middle, and now they just expanding out, expanding out, expanding out.
Or you think it's kind of at a point where it's gonna stand still?
Yeah.
Why not?
Mm-hm.
Right.
Yeah,  and it's already rough.
Like, if you think about  where you can get really fresh produce or  you know, fresh food, like beside at the grocery store- It's limited.
Mm-hm.
example Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Cause I go there,  you know sometimes just to get some bananas or something, and I'm just like, really?
And then it's one line for fifty people.
It's  awful.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.
That's the- Yep.
That's- That's the one thing gotta.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Right.
How do you- How did you- Cause I- I know your son.
I know RD-NAME-1, and I- The reason- And it's so funny how I know him because  um,  I do attendance, and I check attendance and things like that.
So I see his name often, and I think y'all, um- The DC Trust- You were part of the DC Trust program, and so, I have to check their and send their attendance records in so I- I know RD-NAME-1, and I al- When I go over there, I say, hey Ch- You know, he probably doesn't know me, but I always say something.
And when he lost his tooth it was so funny to me.
I thought it was so cute.
Anyway,  um, how did you come to Boys- How did you come  to bring him to the Boys and Girls Club?
Was it here when you guys were  younger?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Right .
Mm-hm.
So you went to Jelleff?
with Bob.
Oh, but he's been there for like forty ye- He's probably been there longer than you've been alive.
The little old- He's like a old- Well, he probably wasn't so old then, but like, kind of a lanky white guy,  and he's still- If you see him, you'll be like, yep, I remember.
Cause he start- I think he was the pool guy at first.
And then he moved to do like,  games and then soccer or something he used to do- And now he's like- He's been there forever.
Mm-hm.
Spring break.
Mm-hm.
It's a life changing- And I've never- I didn't, you know, know about the Boys and Girls Club, and I had one right up the street.
But I was really involved in school, so I didn't go, you know, after school.
I usually was at school until seven or eight o'clock.
And so,  um, I didn't know much about Boys and Girls Club til I moved here, and I was like, Oh my goodness.
Like, it literally was probably-  From here to Seven Eleven  was the distance it was from- from my house.
And didn't know anything about it.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
They have the bus after school, that brings 'em here.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
It's like another family.
Way Mm-hm.
So do you have- Okay, let's  before we go back- I want to go back to RD-NAME-1 for a minute, but I want to go-  Do you have brothers and sisters?
Oh so it's just two of y'all.
I talked to another lady she has- It was fifteen of them.
I said,  I can't imagine.
I'm- I'm a one and one.
Yeah.
I'm the younger sister, and I have a older brother.
w- w- w-  Oh my- It's seven years between me and my brother!
Ah!
That's great.
So I know how it is to be the little sister, and like I don't- I don't- Mm-mm- And yeah- Always getting him in trouble cause I never got in trouble for anything.
It was always his fault.
Oh okay.
I'm sorry f- Yeah, that's the- that's- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
So he did all them little- big brother stuff.
Oh.

Tell me a little bit about  school.
Did you have a favorite teacher?
What was your favorite subject?
Mm.
Pass- Oh um, mm-hm.
I can see it.
Think of the name.
Yup.
Mm-hm.
Oh, and then that's when she- And so she's been principal since then, or did she do some other things and then come back?
Oh so she's been there for a minute.
Okay.
Yeah, I can see it just as plain as day.
Can't think of the name of the place.
It'll probably come to me, just when you're not even thinking about.
Did you have a favorite subject?
No?
Did you you didn't like sch-?
Mm-hm.
Why?
So it wasn't even school that you- You liked all the extra curricular- It wasn't even the school that you was like, oh God.
That it was- Mm-hm.
Okay.
Mm, okay.
I didn't realize he was that old.
Like, I didn't realize- I thought- Not old, like, oh, he's old but I didn't realize- thought we were closer in age.
Um,  but we're ten years- Okay.
Alright.
And did-  so you were on the pom squad.
What was your favorite  moment of that- I m- Just being a part of something, was it a competition you all went to?
Answer.
And you did it all through high school?
Nine through twelve?

You were the class clown .
Oh ma- somebody else ge- Amen.

And you ain't have your cell phone where you can take a picture and a selfie.
Mm.
As part of the class?
Wow.
Side Mm-hm.
Wow.
You had 'em too?
And then- And you were his little sister?
Mm-hm.
And so, the fact that you got to do DC like that, right?
Being a native, I think sometimes we forget-  We-  Like the monuments and all, that's like a very touristy thing  but do you feel like a lot of natives take advantage of that?
Like, do you think a lot of 'em go down and hang out at the Washing- And why not?
Mm-hm.
I agree.
I agree.
Mm-hm.
I love that.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Then nobody else-  Mm-hm.
If you could give on piece of advice,  either thinking about something that you could do over,  or  if you- Like, you said, you looking at kind of our youth today- If you could give one piece of advice, what would it be and why?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Back in- That's-  That's right.
Everything comes to DC.
Everything.
Take it.
Mm-hm.
Princeton.
Yup.

Mm-hm.
Mm.
So close.
You ain't gonna be in debt.
And debt is real.
Do.
You know- It's important.
It-  People don't realize- Cause that's the one thing.
Once you get it, can't nobody take that away from you.
They can steal your phone.
They can steal your car.
They can break into your house.
But once you get that, they cannot take that out your mind.
Talk about your friends a little bit, when you talk about the group of girls you used to run with.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And do something Work.
Mm-hm.
As a hand- Mm-hmm.
Hm.
Right.
I did not know that.
Amen!
I love that.

I did not know that.
So you in a- That's a good situation to be in.
Better.
Oh, excuse me.
Mm.
And go to work.
Mm-hm.
I was just- Cause gas is ex-  It ain't cheap.
Mm-hm.
And it's to better themselves.
So it's not even like you got to go anywhere out the way.
So that's a range of stuff.
Wow.
To fit anybody- To really get you into- mm.
Mm-hm, cause you'll have more in there- You can bargain.
Say, no, look.
This is what I bring to the table.
Yup, and people don't do that enough.
Like, build your skills because people will pay you.
You know, saying if you have x, y, and z people will be like, hey.
Look.
We need to keep her.
Mm-hm, For.
Right, and now you know what to do- Yeah.
That's great.
That is great.
And how long is the class?
That is nothing.
That is no- How often?
Is like, once a week, twice a week?
So just twice a week.
That is good.
Mm-hm.
And the good thing about that is  most jobs,  basic financial stuff, is Excel.
Most- When you give presentations, that's Power Point.
And then if you can type-  You know what I mean?
Like, you can run the- You can manage the office or manage the business because those are your basic things.
You got to be able to sell and market your product and be able to present about it.
You got to make sure your books are right,  and you got to just make sure you report- Do you know what I mean?
And that's great- I didn't know about that serv- That is awesome.
And people don't take adv- Like you said.
And sometimes I think it's ignorance and sometimes it's laziness.
Sometimes they just don't know it's there,  but sometimes they know and they're just like, uh, I don't care, and that's the ones that really make me mad.
Mm, that's- Mm-hm.
