In LaGuardia?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, you can pass it on right?
You weren't on the lease.
Oh no.
Oh.
That's sad.
When was this that you were back and Were you here for a few years?
Oh, tha- so it was recently?
You've be- you've lived all over the city.
You like Manhattan.
But, now, recently, You've crossed up into the Bronx.
How do you like it up there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It takes a long time.
Yeah.
I have a s- my sister-in-law lives in Washington Heights.
I mean, that's a little closer, but still.
From this neighborhood, it's at least an hour, and on the weekends, with the- when the A is local.
Forget it.
I know.
I know.
I know.
Uh.
Se- L- um.
So, I wanna go back to your- your er- kind of earliest memories of about the neighborhood.
Um.
Wha- ha- who were your friends?
When you were a little kid?
And what did you play?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And who lived there?
Now, RD-NAME-2 mentioned he was in the minority.
You know.
Right.
You were- Okay.
Yeah.
It was just really mixed.
And your friends kind of reflected that.
What did you play?
Were you playing tha- y- you had um.
Manhunt.
Uh.
you had a- uh.
Like a playground?
Where'd you play?
Like on the street?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've heard of that.
Somebody hides.
It's- you just try to find them?
Is that.
Right.
Oh.
Yeah.
Is it a flag?
No.
Oh.
I think you're right.
I did play it too.
I .
Right.
Or p-  What's kick the can?
And then what- and then what happens?
Everyone runs at it?
It's like that capture the flag thing.
The can.
Wait.
Had two groups on one side, a can in the middle.
Everyone ran at the can at the same time?
It's illegal in   I just don't really get the point.
Yeah.
Now,  Oh yes.
Go- with the marbles?
No.
Oh, no.
That's pocket.
Oh.
Skellzies.
Or wax or something?
You make it like aerodynamic.
Okay.
Right.
Yeah.
They were perfect.
And the point was to slide it.
Yeah.
And how far away?
Like feet away?
Or.
So it was like a big area.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You were the winner.
And could you um,  like,  push another guy's out?
You had to start from a certain.
You were penalized somehow.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
That's funny.
Okay.
Were your, uh, were your parents strict?
Or uh, easy going?
like were you able to kind of go out and explore as a kid?
Okay.
Okay.
I believe it, I see.
So, you'd get in trouble if you didn't get back by five.
But But they knew you were- you're mom wasn't  keeping tabs on you during the day?
You got to- Yeah.
Right.
And were you- were you staying kind of close to home when you went out and about?
or did you.
Where ever the girls were.
Right.
RD-NAME-1 and them.
Vladecks.
Yeah.
Were- was one better than the other?
Mm-hm.
This kind of sounds like a little gang-like.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did it ever escalate into.
You- you were not a type to get into fights?
You- So, you were not a fighter?
Is he telling the truth?
I think you were a fighter Gary.
I think- I think that uh.
Or it's ju- I think- I- I think that RD-NAME-2's talking Oh yeah.
that there was definitely like, just  there- there- there was a definite change in the neighborhood  from seventy  three or four on.
As opposed to, one of the examples was  the ethnicity, when we were  five, six, seven, eight and ten, it was  Italian,  German, Irish, uh- whites,  uh- p- Spanish, Chinese and stuff.
Then, the- it sort of changed as some of those people either died, the elderly,  or they moved out of the neighborhood, or they left their parents  they moved out  then the parents died.
At one point, just to reiterate, I- I was like the only Jewish family in there.
Yeah.
I remember you had said that.
A-  You know, but that was more like the.
That was later on.
That was when I was sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.
Mm-hm.
Which, so, there was that ten year period from six to sixteen  that i- it started to becoming less diverse.
and getting wilder.
Yeah.
This was petty  if I'm in the Smith,  they'd throw an egg at me, say, get the fuck out of here, or something like that.
But, at seventy-five,  you might get knifed or stabbed when the javelins and the- and the lords and all of them, and so.
It was a change.
You have to definitely-  there is a period  how violent that would have gotten.
Mm.
You know.
Did you experience that?
Yeah.
But you saw that- the change that RD-NAME-2 was talking about?
And this was in the- It's actually Seventy-two.
The Seventies, there was change.
Yeah.
And- and then how did it  sort of effect you, in d- or- or I guess  as you got older?
You weren't playing skellzies anymore.
What were you what were you doing ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Girls are very important.
Had to go over to Smith to find them.
Right.
W- when you guys moved to Williamsburg?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
When you did come back,  w- uh,  what did you noticed had changed?
Yeah.
I mean, it.
Can you talk about that a little bit?
There were?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Getting bigger.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right, right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, this is, you're talking about- this is  when in- Two Thousand One?
So, um.
Did you notice, I mean, b- by Two Thousand One, the larger neighborhood, you have this  a lot of gentrification happening with  you know, wealthier, white  folks coming in,  Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
And it maybe it doesn't affect, um,  public housing in the same way, Right.
Really?
Yeah.
We know.
Right.
I'm renting my bathroom to 'em    Oh you got no salary or something.
I think we got that.
A- Yeah.
So, you could see that, when you came back, that kind of larger.
In  Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
And- but you don't have any family that's still down here?
You said your brother passed away.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
That's interesting.
So, now you've lived all over  New York City.
I'm wondering if you would still consider yourself a Lower East Sider?
If that's sort of a that's a important part of you.
Okay.
Yeah.
What- You re-   Music.
That's what you were- that was important, right?
Yeah.
And what did you do personally?
Oh, I was gonna ask what personally di- uh, were you- instruments or singing did you do?
Cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bobby's on my CD by the way.
I think I gave you  You gave me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I listened to it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think he's on it.
Yeah.
And this you were doing in your- sort of in your free time, cause you're still working Yeah.
Yeah.
And, have you continued to that throughout your life?
S- Still doing it.
That's terrific.
Cool.
Kind of like this uh, this set up?
Play in the subway.
You do?
Cool, cool.
And are you- are you working as well?
Or are- Oh, that's wonderful That's nice.
Be a little bit  of your time too.
Yeah.
Um.
So, I  you can tell I'm interested in the kind of the Lower East Side, uh,  as a community.
And,  uh.
One thing I always ask people is  for them, like for you,  what  is the Lower East Side geographically?
Cause a lot of people have different renditions of it.
Yeah.
It could have changed.
But, maybe then and now, or whatever.
The Manhattan Bridge.
Yeah.
I think they've expanded?
Really?
They call- yeah.
East Village is sort of the.
It is.
It feels.
Does it feel like the same neighborhood to you?
Right, right.
Um.
Okay, cool.
So, we have these  geographic boundaries for the neighborhood.
What I wanna know is if all the people who live inside those streets make up  like, one community, one Lower East Side community?
And I think if  i- to ask you that, first, I need to ask you to define  community, like what does that mean?
And  what does it mean for people to be in a community together?
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
So, i- so it's m- uh-  sounds like maybe a little more than just live.
But, i- somehow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
E- Yeah.
It is.
Yeah.
So it's- So it's a little more than just kind of living in the same place.
You hafta.
Interact, or something  Yeah.
So, that's my next question.
Does it seem is- is the same.
Why, why is that?
Yeah.
What do you think happened?
Yeah.
I think you're a little more radical than that.
Speak your mind.
No.
Cause I've heard you.
I've hear- I'm not influencing you, but.
You know, you- You and I spoke about how there's no money inv- we- we played on the jazz mobile,  we played for constant street fairs when we were kids and you don't see any of that anymore.
Yeah.
And, and, and, I know you and I  So, like, money is being taken out of the neighborhood?
I mean.
What do you thi- yeah, what do you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How- well that's- Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
That's part of it.
Do you think that's been happening for a while?
Or recently?
Yeah.
You could talk about a couple different like, periods of the neighborhood, you know, when I- when I read kind of, what's been written about.
You did?
Cool.
Woah.
With the sword?
That's cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
A way for people to find common ground.
Right.
Okay.
Right.
Now,  the time that you guys were growing up though- you were young and teenagers, wha- what I was gonna say, is when I read, you know, books about the Lower East Side,  considered kind of a- a- bad period.
In the sense that there was a lot of crime and drugs in the neighborhood.
It's just natural.
And so, it's interesting that in spite- It was.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
And I- and- and- you didn't get involved, but did it affect friends of yours and people around you?
Still involved.
Hard to quit right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That- that seems to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That seems like a really positive attitude.
I mean a lot of people weren't as successful maybe as ignoring, or saying okay, I'm not.
Right.
Yeah.
Right.
And then, okay.
So then,  there's that sort of  stuff happening, and then  maybe in the eighties, nineties, you get this gentrification starting, with, uh, a sort of an opposite force.
Like,  um.
With the  yuppie people moving in.
A little later.
Yeah.
And so that's ch- kind of changed the character.
I mean I'm sort of trying to figure out, like what's changed this community feeling?
Right.
Yeah.
Is any of it, like, class related?
Like are the-  the more yuppie type people that are moving in.
Yeah.
Or- Yeah.
Within class, or.
Lower middle, or   Right.
Right.
Right.
I'd say we were middle lower.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's your opinion about  uh, sort of general gentrification of the Lower East Side?
Is it something you see.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can I just say something real quick about what would have done.
Yeah.
At one point, your family make up was your mother,  your younger brother,  that's not with us anymore, and you had your grandmother.
And then you had your older brother staying there for a little while.
Okay.
Gentrification, your mother wouldn't have been able to-  to have that type of large apartment like that under the normal rents if she wasn't in the projects.
No.
Well, what would have happened right there?
Your grandmother woulda had to go to a s- to an old age home, She passed away in your house.
God bless her.
I hope that happens to me.
Mm.
Your brother,  who was a little dysfunctional, your younger brother, whatever, would have probably been in jail.
Your other brother,  would have been  just bopping around.
He had no family ties.
And then, your mother would also felt bad cause she didn't have her family around.
So, I- I don't mean to interject in that, but that- that woulda been in a like an exact outcome of her- of- that would have been what happened  if-  if she wouldn't've had those assets of- of the projects.
With low rent.
Right.
No doubt.
That woulda killed that.
Your family community.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
So, you see some positive effects of gentrification.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
So, you see sort of positives and- positives and negatives at the same time.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yea- it's co- I mean, it's complicated like you said.
Um.
These are so good.
If I uh, if I asked you if there were a coup-  uh, uh, a few  places for you,  in the neighborhood,  that stick out in your  time that you spent there as like, really important to you.
Um.
Places where you spent time, or- or that really matter to you.
What would you say?
Mm-hm.
Oh, you did?
Karate, fencing, you know a lot of cool sports.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
So, you guys were just playing.
You'd set up your own equipment.
And you start playing.
And what kind of music was is?
Mm-hm.
Right, right.
Yeah.
What about the music that you play now?
Or you- can you categorize?
R and B.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
It's unique.
Right, right.
Okay.
Yeah.
You spent enough- you spent a lot of time there.
Okay.
Right.
Did you uh, end up on the bench?
Or  That's such a classic story.
And they immediately pulled you back on the bench?
Then the other team offered you a contract.
That's hilarious.
Okay.
That  place, yeah.
LaGuardia Projects.
Manhunt.
They also bought us equipment.
Remember?
They bought our band equipment?
Bought us equipment.
Henry Street?
They did?
Yeah.
They told us to go home and write up.
The guy got mad at me.
He yelled at me.
This is when you were teenagers?
Yeah.
We're like thirteen, fourteen years old.
And he like, was talking all big to us.
And you young lads,  will do this and everything.
God wants you to go  home, write up what equipment you need.
So, we went to the  store, and it came to like three thousand dollars.
And we went into this big meeting in a board room, and we're like, oh, what'll they think?
And he's talking all of this thing, and I'm gonna get these kids equipment.
Give me the paper.
When we handed him the paper, he saw that three thousand dollars  He went  started choking.
And did he say it's too much?
Yeah.
He want- think he wanted to give us a hundred fifty bucks or something.
He- Oh.
So you ca- we-  So we whittled him down to three hundred dollars or like four hundred dollars or something.
Yeah.
Four hundred fifty.
We got something out of it.
But E- Cause equipment is expensive.
That was so-  I- and the way he said, he was a big shot.
So, he'd be talking, you know, get whatever you need.
And then we laughed at him, and he got mad.
Cause he said a guitar?
Three hundred?
I thought a guitar is fifteen dollars, and we started to laugh.
Now,  was laughing at a grown man who is ignorant of how much it should cost, and he got mad at us.
At me.
Yeah.
He got mad at me.
S- Sorry man, you're stupid, but I remember, that was funny.
I remember that.
What's a guitar cost?
Fifteen dollars.
Oh now?
It's about twelve hundred bucks.
Oh.
Yeah.
A decent one yeah.
Back then, was like three hundred.
Like, he was like, he said fifteen dollars, we all laughed, and he got mad.
And he yelled at me.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
Okay.
Or they used us for that four hundred   They pla- they played for  Free entertainment.
Free.
November Wednesdays.
I'm like what?
That's not even a holiday.
That's a.
Yeah.
Camp- Camp return day.
We're like, what?
That's really funny.
Yeah.
Cool, cool.
Um.
I also really wanted to ask your opinion about um,  housing and development in the neighborhood.
So, I'm sure you've noticed  some of the  luxury buildings going up  in the area.
Definitely noticeable.
Um.
I mean,  What's your take on that?
I guess, personally?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right, right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's um.
There- there's a site.
I'm not sure if you've seen it since I know you don't live around here right now, but, um, it's been a parking lot for about forty years.
So, you may have seen it.
Just south of Delancey Street.
By the Williamsburg Bridge.
Just where the Williamsburg Bridge starts.
Uh.
Clinton,  like Clinton and Delancey.
And it's right at the entrance of the Williamsburg Bridge.
There's a big area of parking lots.
Does that sound familiar?
One of the group Yeah!
Exactly.
Exactly right there.
One of the groups that I work with is- is really interested in getting that land developed.
So, I ask everyone that I interview Um.
Like, what their personal opinion is, because i- if you've seen it,  it's- it's actually  the biggest plot of land south of Ninety-Sixth Street  that's undeveloped.
And, it's owned by the city.
And so, it's- it's a big space.
And, so I ask everybody that I interview  um,  like, if it were up to you,  what do you think  should get built there?
Like what do you think the community could use or needs?
What would you put there?
Yeah.
Right.
Like a Henry Street Settlement?
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What di- what's your sense of what kids are doing now?
Hang on the street corner.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you still close to your kids?
Do they live in the city?
Kids still live with you?
Oh, cool.
Is that one reason why you moved up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, community center you think's a would be a good thing for the neighborhood.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Right.
Getting into trouble.
Right.
And you said low income housing  is in need of that too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um.
Do y- Do you have a take on- on like the height of buildings that get built in the neighborhood?
Is that something that you think should be restricted?
Oh- some people do.
It's like a big issue.
Doesn't matter to you.
Th- like the- like some of the buildings that kind of stick out of the tenements or something?
Doesn't bother you.
Okay.
Right.
Stick out.
Right.
Right, right.
Um.
Do you think that, cause there's a lot of new people moving into the neighborhood.
Do you think that it's important for them to know about the history of the Lower East Side?
From the time that you lived there, or even before what.
Yeah, because it's it's such a fascinating neighborhood.
And it has such a long history.
And there's so many groups that have come and come here and immigrated and lived here.
All that kind of stuff.
Right.
Yeah.
Right.
Learning a little bit about the place where you live.
There is.
And I- and a lot of it is a history of people kind of coming here to start  over, start fresh.
And it sounds like maybe your parents even felt- Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Do you think that this is a neighborhood where  people can still do that?
Come here to sort of start  over, start fresh, build a new life?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right, right.
