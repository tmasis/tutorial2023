Mm.
Mm.
Well, how would you describe the neighborhood for someone who isn't here?
Like, what does it look like?
Is it like houses, or?
Yeah.
It's interesting you  bring up the food desert point because  like, that's not something I realized until I became an adult.
You know how few  grocery stores that there are just period in the city, and even the Wegmans on Mount Hope left.
So, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yes, me too.
Yeah, and then I think there's maybe a Price Right in- Yeah.

Um, and so, had you always wanted to go to RD-SCHOOL-3?
Or what were your-  Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Um, for you, how was your first year adjusting from like-   RD-SCHOOL-1 cause you know I know about it, I think going to RD-SCHOOL-2 and I mean, that's its own kind of school, but.
And, yeah.
What?
Like just hearing that breaks my heart.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Now I've never gone to any in San Francisco, cause I'm just like, I doubt I'll know anybody, and if I go I  don't know if anybody will really talk to me, you know, yeah.
I can totally I identify with that.
That's great.
Now because you said this though, now I'm like oh, well maybe I should check it out.

Cool, so do you still talk to like, RD-NAME-1 and- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah I- I go back and visit RD-NAME-1 cause he was my advisor, so.
Yeah but I haven't really been up there as much, unless I'm like- they ask me if I'm around to  teach a class, or something like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
But I find myself- I meet a lot of other like RD-SCHOOL-4.
Just,  in the field, you know.
Which is kind of cool, I- like to have that connection with other people.
Like, um, who have been through the program too, so.
Um,   okay, yeah so, let's talk a little bit about grad school then.
Yeah.
What, uh, made you decide to, um- Okay.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.

Yeah.
And so, um, you went to Penn, or- RD-SCHOOL-3, RD-SCHOOL-3 okay, cool.
Okay, and,  so, when you made that transition, what was it like?
Did you like RD-SCHOOL-3, or, e- or, es- especially, like, in comparison to the RD-SCHOOL-9.
What kind of- Mm.
Yeah.
Well, um, no, so-  no, that was good, um, and t- and you know me, I have to be- ask a selfish question.
Cause I'm in grad school in my dissertation phase, so, you know, how for you was the dissertation phase?
Ah.
Yeah, yeah.
I totally,  relate, like, yeah, but I'm just kind of like, right now, in data collection, phase so it's just like, get as much as you can.
Um,  but,  uh, wh- what was the question I was gonna ask?
Um, oh, I wanted to ask, so,  in your program, at what point did you decide, okay,  I do, or don't wanna do academia?

Okay, cool.
Okay, cool.
Um,   I just wanna turn back to s- a few more general questions about Rochester and that's more so as a person who has moved away and coming back to Rochester, what do you see are some like, major changes to you, that has happened in the city?
Yeah.
Okay,  and- but are there any-  when you come to Rochester, I guess, what are your favorite things to do here?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah,  it makes sense.
Uh, let's see,    okay, those are  m- uh, my last few questions about Rochester specifically, like as a place.
But I always, um,  ask a few questions at the end about  uh, language related stuff, so.
Uh, sort of, um, have you been told, that you have an accent?
Um, being from Rochester?
And maybe what things do people say  make them think you have a accent?
think you have a accent?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Okay.
And, um,    let's see,  when you come back,  and you- like, you haven't been here for a little while do you feel like there's certain people, maybe who lived in certain parts of the city like they talk differently, or?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah.
No, yeah, yeah.
Um,   yeah, so that's basically all the questions I have related to language, and um, I always like to ask, uh,  if you have any maybe last thoughts, you wanna say?
If not then  we can wrap it up.
