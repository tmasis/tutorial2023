Mm-hm.
Well the longest I know  um,  after you pass  the Bell House up there?
With the fence around?
Well I know her a good while.
She and her husband,  but then it's a trailer.
And then  the next  it's a brick house.
Now  and then  on the other side of her house, her sister house.
We were raised up over the railroad together.
The RD-NAME-2.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm- all us lived over the railroad.
Mm-hm.
We went to school.
Me and her youngest sister, their youngest sister went to school but she been dead  uh,  right many years.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-mm.
They just-  they been married but they-  I know they- they husband dead.
Mm-hm.
Uh- RD-NAME-4 and RD-NAME-5.
Mm-hm.
I don't know.
Sometime they  feel bad but I could call RD-NAME-3.
Uh-  RD-NAME-3 has arthritis.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
She died two years ago.
My aunt dead.
Uh-mm-hm.
Close.
Mm-hm.
And my first cousin.
They seem like  more like sisters to me.
Cause when our grandma was living    and our mother used to work over Rocky Mount, they would- all us would be  over the railroad together.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
She was a good lady.
Mm-hm.
I don't remember her spanking us.
I-  I bet she would tell us mother.
If- If my mother- she would  uh-  growed up small but she would spank you though.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
And that's her picture there.
Hm.
And she was.
Uh-hm.
Yeah.
Oh yes I did.
I- I thought I got more whoopings than the boys.
Mm.
Yeah, if you go to see something- play with somebody you- you weren't supposed to stay over your time.
Mm-hm.
Mm, not too late but you was supposed to come back, you know, the time you was supposed to come back.
Mm, mm.
- Yeah.
But I know one thing, but they didn't do that-  Uh, the old folk would sit on the porch and talk  and they would- they wouldn't uh,  let you out after sunset.
They- some would dip stuff  if you-  if you be looking at them   tryna to see what they were talking talk about but they were spitting that stuff after.
But I didn't ever get that done.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yes it was, I  know one thing,  uh, when we were growing up you-  we-  it was a woods back of us over there, and I remember we had to go out there and get  all the wood that you burnt and you cook with that wood.
Mm-hm.
Yeah it was small.
I know- uh- what I remember about that was uh,  Bridger's store.
And I know  at that time, I was coming up,  it wont a telephone over there, telephone wont plentiful.
Well one  lady on Main Street,  this was this uh,  lady RD-NAME-3 mother and grandmother.
They had a telephone.
I think their telephone was on the wall, and if you need a doctor or something, you could go out there and they would let you use it.
I think- I reckon they had one in the store later but I don't know-  you know, that's-  i- where everybody would go to use the phone if you need it for something special.
Not over here.
Oh, cause we went over town  and-  and-  it was a new bread-  uh- New Bern Mill down  before you cross the bridge.
Now they had a   and we used to go there.
Mm-mm.
This was New Bern Mill.
Cause they would sell cheese, and I remember  my grandma-  you-  they- you- they send you down there you could get five or ten cent piece of cheese and looked like it was  about a half of pound of what they sell there.
And they would make the cheese biscuit- look like they were so good.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I- I got more than one.
At that time it was.
I don't eat too many biscuits now.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Before you got to the bridge.
I reckon you seen a cleaning place  over there  across the street on the other side.
Sometimes folk go up there and sell stuff, but this  uh, store across from that.
Cause it was houses all along there.
And across the street at that time.
Mm-hm.
Well those houses down there  are- some were joined together.
They was old.
But it has improved a lot over here.
Mm-hm.
At that time, you had to pump all the water you- you know, got  that-  maybe one, two, or three folks had running water you know with them pumps.
Cause that's the first thing that we got here when uh,  my husband RD-NAME-4 was living, he was working for RD-WORK-2 when I met him.
And  um,  mm- he was working with my step father.
And it wont no  running water over here,  but we went together  and got us a electric pump and man put it down.
And then  I forget this man name.
He was a white man stayed in Leggett.
He d- he built a bar    for the sewer  thing out there.
Mm-hm.
Until the town  got water,  and I thank God for that.
I remember.
I can't tell you what year it was, but they got it I went and signed up for it.
Mm-hm.
Way after I had moved here.
Y- y- we should ask somebody else about that.
Dang.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And before the  flood,  I just had a air conditioning, that one that had  fans?
But  after the flood,  they put me  uh- Uh-huh.
And he-  and I thank God for that.
Mm-hm-hm.
Yeah, well back- we didn't have the running water.
Mm-  That's all I can remember.
You had-  you- it- it didn't  floo- I don't remember going out  over there but about  twice before  but it wont nothing like Floyd.
I never seen nothing like that.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, hopscotch.
Yeah,  stuff like that.
And then throw balls and catch 'em.
I reckon eat.
Mm-hm-hm.
But I can't eat like that now.
Mm-mm.
I just don't wanna.
Oh what?
For dinners, well,  i-  we had um-  I know they cooked collards cause my grandmom, looked like every time it rained she was at- was out there  sitting out with something.
Is she- is she- now she had uh-  she kept her garden just as clean out of sight ?.
And then they raise hogs  too over there cause you could raise 'em then.
And  I would te- I said- I call my grandmama Ma, I said Ma, my back hurt.
She said, you hush, you ain't got nothing but a .
But- Mm- Mm-hm.
Yes, she was excellent cook.
Well she cooked chicken.
We had to raise chicken too.
But I got out with chicken one time.
Because  um,  that was after my grandmother died.
A lady  ca-  this first house we lived in it was good size house, and my mama let  one of the uh- my grandmama friend move on one side, and she and her husband had a whole of chicken, and they didn't have but one son.
And they be gone to work, and that son would kill the chicken to cook.
They worked hard   cause everyone that cooked the chicken .
And I got out with chicken for about a year.
Mm-hm.
Yeah they just had one child and he-  he would- uh,  kill the chicken and  m- uh- some us cook it but-  It was a time.
Mm-hm.
And-  and  peas and bean but it looked like anything my mama cook it was good to me.
It sure was.
And I reckon that's what  I got sugar from- I had a step dad,  but he was a good eater too.
And a-  and we- and we- my mama cook all this food.
And don't care.
We sit down at our reg- it looked like we- and we  made her children help me raise and my mama wont a big eater.
And we just eat eat.
And he'd barbecue pig.
And we'd eat that- that- that great big  .
And we didn't need all that food.
Mm-mm.
Mm-hm.
It sure was.
And Christmas time, they would cook all them cakes,  and they had them-  they had them saved with the glass though  and pack 'em in there.
But stuff would keep better now and then.
And they went-  they would uh, go in the  country and  it was a-  Mr.
RD-NAME-4 stayed out there .
He would send a truck up here  and  to pick cotton or chop cotton or whatever.
And they would always buy up a plenty stable  food  when they'd be working.
And then in the winter,  when they wont making as much, you still could eat.
And they would um,  kill them  hogs and  salt 'em down.
That meat- and it would keep.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
S- what they could salt down.
But that fresh-  that  fresh cut meat when they kill a hog.
That was real good too.
Mm-hm.
No I don't cook that much.
I- I fix my breakfast but  today  I ate oatmeal  and  cut a banana in it.
I never liked oatmeal.
Mm-mm.
I eat grits but I don't like oatmeal but , he's sickly,  I'm just forcing it down.
I put a banana in it.
Mm-hm.
I hate to even look at it.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.
I cook.
But see, if I cook a pot of something and I put part in it to eat  and put part in the freezer, and then I go back.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And when- and when I don't eat to my sister.
Cause she told me Saturday, you come by here  and you eat.
And then- Mm-hm.
She always do that.
Mm-hm.
She had cooked the meat though, string bean  and  corn, fried corn.
And they had rows  and my brother put a-  a sweet potato, put it in the stove.
And- And it was good.
Mm-hm.
Hm?
Mm-hm.

Thirty years difference.
Cause sometime we be together and s- and somebody don't know, and they say,  is that your mother?
And- and she said, mm-mm.
I said, I'm her sister.
And they do- I said, don't feel bad cause I'm old enough to be her mama .
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.
About-  I know over ten years.
Over ten.

Mm-hm.
Mm-hm, but he been in Service.
He stayed in Service I reckon about-  He did-  he did seven- about-  sure if he is I reckon, cause he's been thinking about going back to finish up his time.
Mm-hm.

Mm-mm.
He was in the Navy.
And the one died was in the Marines.
And  the oldest one was in the Army.
And then  the one in-  the- the younger one where in uh,  Norfolk, He went to the Air Force.
But he joined  before he was of age.
So he didn't stay in there long as the other one's did.
Mm-hm, to get in there.
Mm-mm.
I was just working  uh, helping clean up in the Navy yard in Portsmouth Virginia.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Cause they can probably tell you more things than I can cause they like to fly.
And I never flown, even my mama flew two times.
Cause my baby sister got sick  in Seattle, Washington.
And she flew up there.
And I know she-  if she wont eighty then it wont far from it.
Uh, she got on that plane and went by herself.
Took her to Raleigh Durham Airport, and she went up there and then she come back.
She enjoyed it so, and she went the next year on a trip up there.
Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.

Mm-mm.
Yeah.
It- it- well my sis- baby sister went over sea with her husband in Germany.
She got sick over there.
And she done told me,  my mama asked her,  did she want her to come over there?
She had plenty nerve then.
And all  of 'em flew but me.
Cause when my uh,  step baby um-  Mm.
the brother  next to my   baby- the  baby brother,  well he uh,  went over sea.
He was going over sea, and me and my mama took him up to  Raleigh Durham Airport, and  we got up there that morning, that-  that uh-  it was  foggy.
And they wont let no planes come up, neither go down  until it cleared up.
And when- I was working out RD-WORK-7 then,  but when  it faired up  and that-  they- they-  their  plane  got in- that was gonna- they was gonna let it go up?
And that plane kept at first going up, and I went just a crying.
My mama looked at me, said what you crying for?
I was crying cause my brother was on that plane and it was keeping up  while it's going up.
No, I know I couldn't ride one.
Everybody said once you get up it ride good.
But I don't want to find out.
Mm-hm.
