Where'd you go to school?
Hm.
Yup.
Mm-hm.
And that's probably where it came from.
That makes a lot of sense.
I come from a small town, and we have our two high schools   so the night of the big football game,  city-  the city- I mean everybody's at the football game.
And so one year we were in the I guess semi finals and we played in the Georgia Dome.
And so the t-shirts says whoever- whoever is the last one, turn off the light and we'll see you at the Dome.
Like everybody- we drove four hours for everybody to go see these two teams that are five miles apart from each other go play in the Dome we drove five hours- four hours to go see them  play  and but that was just how big- so I understand like-  I understand rivalries and- and- and that makes a lot of sense.
And- and so but also the- the importance of connection.
I think you going back to the- the whole city and  and people being connected, right?
Um, and- and you're not the first person to say that to me that it's really about  cause I need to know who you know.
I need to know, and- and so neighborhoods are really important.
Cause I need to know who you know and how you know them and who you live with and who live- live-   I need to know.
Are you legit?
