And I would just rem- He would always come to Miss RD-NAME-2's desk, and make sure.
And she would ask him, do you have any homework, and he'll say yes or no, and he'll do his little stuff.
Then he'll go play, he'll come back, or he'll get a book.
I mean, he was always- But you could tell he was very intelligent.
Even like- Cause it- he was about six at that point, six, seven.
And so, um,  that's great.

So I wanna go to go go for a minute because I remember I think I came to your class once, but I was- well, I was watching your class because I was- so Miss RD-NAME-2 I think could come to your class cause there was nobody at the front desk.
Um, and I was just like-  and I didn't really know about go go cause I had just moved here.

It's so funny, my boyfriend was showing me a YouTube clip,  um, of  ah, I can't remem- maybe it's Backyard, but,  um,  they- they put him on display.
He was so excited, like he's like, now listen, you gotta listen, cause this is my- watch, watch, just listen.

And so for here they would just-  it- separate neighborhoods?
Or is it just Uptown?
Like I know like, some s- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay, alright, alright.
So,  let me ask you this, what?
like,   recently I was hearing some-  some of the like,  maybe around your age and a little older saying they don't really go to go gos anymore cause they've gotten a little more dangerous.
Do you feel like that?
Mm-hm.
Was it Let it Flow?
Mm, d- are- w- uh, jazz?
Do they infuse jazz in- And add a twist to it?
Who was it?
Marlee?
Marlee in the Mixx?
Or Marlee in the Mixx?
Or something like that.
Um,    I heard them, they were- we went to a  like a little spot on U Street and they were performing.
And we went back, just to see- Like I really like- Cause it- I think it's more like kind of the grown and sexy like you called it.
Because it was-  it was an older crowd, probably like, you know,  thirties, forties, fifties, like that age group, it wasn't like no teenagers and stuff.
And just  drinks and food and they were performing, it was wonderful.
That's where I was.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
So talking about U Street,  cause-  So you remember when U Street- Kind of talk about  if you remember it changing, right?
So like when it was live, then it went down, now it's-  Tell me some earlier memories of it.
Like, when you were younger.
Is Indulge open or is it closed?
Cause when I was on U Street, uh, a few weeks ago- Maybe, cause they're right across- they're not too far from Ben's, right?
They're- it's right across and then go like, down a door or something like that?
I-  I'm- cause I'm'a go back that way cause I'm'a go over to, uh, Benning Road, so I'm'a- I'm'a ride back.
Cause last time I was there we were at, um, Alero.
And- but I rode that way to get to Alero.
And I didn't-  Cause it- there's some construction going on next to it.
I don't know if it's condos or if they're building a new- Why you say- Oh, that's where I'm going now.
Mm.
Why do you think that's so?
Like why is it such a big difference?
Mm-hm.
Bedroom, right.
Right right right.
Don't go for- It's a lot.
It's- Mm-hm.
On Minnesota Avenue.
Mm.
So no longer Chocolate City?
Mm.
Do you feel like that makes it safer?
Or do you feel like it- Mm.
Because of everybody getting pushed out?
Like section eight-ish stuff like that.
Several hundred thousands.
If not close to a million.
Mm-hm.
Um, three tree or something like that.
Mm-hm.
I looked into the rent for those, too.
Yup.
Like, thirteen hundred for like a  studio maybe.
Um, fifteen hundred or something like that for a two bedroom.
Which is better than other places in- but still.
I was reading- a friend of mine posted an article on Facebook saying you have to make at least thirty dollars an hour to have a one bedroom  in DC.
Mm-hm.
And so that's- you know, that's someone forty-five, fifty thousand dollars a year,  and not everybody's making forty-five, fifty thousand dollars a year to- Mm-mm, what, twenty-five, thirty thousand?
And you barely like-  It's- it's tough, it's tough.
You might get a room.
Mm.
High.
Mm-mm.
Now that's what?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yup.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
It's- it's- it's a lot.
Do you feel- do you feel like  you are at a point where  you feel like it's- for you it's stable and you don't have to- you know, you're not trying to say, okay well, we gonna-  we can't stay here, or we gotta be moved out  cause you in a good place?
Business, right Have that side hustle.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm,  always, always.
Mm-hm.
Between the two, mm-hm.
Push your kid.
Exactly, that's what you- that's always.
Y'all promoting each other and You trying to do it for him, and he trying to do it for you and it's just all working out.
So have you seen- What do you- what's your goal?
Like what ultimately- like what d- when you say, I've arrived, this is-  this is what I  consider success, what is that for you?
Mm-hm.
Right.
But the mission.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I saw the- um, the board in the back with the  I was like, I love this, I love- cause it- it really-  Just like I was- you know,  we talk to the staff,  what we do here is great, but if- if- if the same kinds of lessons and things like that aren't happening once they leave here,  it's all for naught.
Like, because they're here for two hours, they're at home for ten hours.
That's five times more at home, so if you not- you know, if you not saying, let's drink water or let's go for a walk or, you know, let's make sure that we,  um, are good citizens, or we study and we do the thing,  it doesn't matter.
And so that's gr- I love the fact that it's- it's not simply like, okay that's what you did here, or did- No, but we're doing- we're embracing these things, I love that.
I love it, I love- So I'm'a ask you a unhealthy question cause- cause we talking about-  So,    one of the things that DC is known for is mumbo sauce.
So tell me a little bit about- Do you like mumbo sauce?
Okay, tell me why.
Now where- where do you get it from?
Mm-hm.
Me t-  I'm still learning.
I ask people about it, but it's- Like you can't buy it in stores.
You just have to go- Me neither.
Nobody does.
It's kind of a mystery, cause if you go to one place it's- thick, if you go to another place it's-
