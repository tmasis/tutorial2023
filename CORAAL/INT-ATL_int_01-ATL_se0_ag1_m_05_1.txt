Okay.
S- uh, RD-NAME-3 here,  and I'm the interviewer, and I'm- well,  I'm with, um,  Mr.
RD-NAME-1.
Um,  RD-NAME-1 can you give us  your full name?
RD-NAME-4, and  we are now about to conduct this  somewhat interview conversational piece for,  uh,  a good bit of m-  time.
So  without further ado let's, um,  get all the way into it.
Mr.
RD-NAME-2  RD-NAME-1  don't you got a stage name,  um, okay.
World take over DJ.
Okay.
Nah, that's- that's real real cool,  you know.
Um, I'm  probably gonna be segueing to a bunch of different stuff if that's cool with you.
Okay, cool, cool.
So, um,  what's your race or nationality?
What do you identify as?
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.
And, um,  what's your age?
Cool, cool, cool.
Um,  and  where were you born?
Decatur, GA.
Okay.
So, um,  is it cool to assume that you been living in Georgia  predominantly  your whole life?
Great, great, great.
Okay, so, um,  growing up in Georgia,  you know,  let's start with maybe  middle school or something like that.
What was, um,  growing up in middle school in Decatur, Georgia or wherever  you was in Georgia in particular?
Yeah, what school you went to?
Okay.
Mm.
That's- that's very very interesting cause  I be feeling that way sometimes personally  just from my life like, dang, maybe like  almost ten, twenty years ago, things looked totally different than the way they look kind of right now.
Um, and I didn't know that that's how  it was rocking over in RD-SCHOOL-3 Middle.
M- so  was that school kind of, um,  fairly new at that time?
Or has that al- always been around?
Wow.
Mm-hm.
Okay, but, um, you left  old ass RD-SCHOOL-3 School to end up going into like  new facility RD-SCHOOL-3 High School?
Mm-hm.
Wow, okay.
See, um,  it's been a while since I personally been  back to RD-SCHOOL-3, almost probably about ten years now.
So I w- I would defer to you f- as far as knowing,  you know, how the kids and that culture  is over there right about now.
Mm.
Okay.
Just to, um, segue away from the school system for a second,  um,  tell me a little bit  about  your parents.
Like where were they born and raised?
Okay, that's what I'm talking about.
So  they was up in there living the good life up in Cleveland and Detroit,  and they came down to old  Georgia.
Or- or was the good life-  was it that- that good of a life up in Cleveland and  Detroit cause I know it's- it's kind of different  all around.
Did you b- did you ever ask about that?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Ay, okay.
Mm-hm.
Ah, digging that.
So, um,  you got any plans on  what you gonna do with your  family life as far as  staying in the area or branching out  from here?
Mm.
Mm.
Nah, cool, cool, cool.
Feel the same exact way   even though I do got a girl, still,  you know.
Definitely, definitely.
What you call it again?
Um,  how about siblings?
Do you have any?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh, okay.
And what's your, um,  relationship with them?
Cool?
Not so cool?
Mm-hm.
That makes a lot of sense.
I can dig that.
Let's see.
Um,  back-  going back to the school thing, um,  I guess more so  high school.
How did you get to school?
Mm.
Mm.
Wow.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
That was a pretty  good question then cause I n- I don't know.
I- a lot of people just be like, oh yeah, I just took the cheese bus.
Definitely.
Mm-hm.
That's convenient.
Nice, nice.
Um,  did you have any, um, favorite subjects or-  or some subjects you didn't like  as much?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, that's more than enough, for real.
Let's see.
Um,  this says friendship group.
Is there a group of people  you hang around  with  or whatever?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Uh, cool, cool, cool.
I guess, um,  you know, other than baseball, what would y'all do together?
Uh,  middle school, high school a-  and- and the- uh, yeah.
Nah, definitely,  definitely feel you on that.
Let's see.
What about, um,  your first job?
Okay.
Oh, cool, cool, cool.
So, um,  we talking about RD-ADDRESS-2 Road.
We talking about RD-ADDRESS-3.
You know, this some  born and raised type of stuff.
Do you feel like, um, that East Atlanta area  have a,  um, particular type of dialect, and you can possibly tell  who's from that area when they talk?
Mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
You think so.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
okay.
Mm.
Real heavy, right?
I- I- I think that's very very famil- um, interesting  because  I done did a few folks  from the East Atlanta area,  and, um,  you're here born and raised.
I'm here born and raised and stuff like that,  but I don't  necessarily think I have the most  Atlanta,  you know,  dialect in some- certain people eyes and stuff like that.
When I go out of town,  or if I'm just around certain people, they might be like,  where you from?
I'm from Atlanta.
What, really?
I'm like, yeah, nigga, what the fuck?
But, um, I d- I- I- I get what you're saying with the west side,  you know, not to stereotype, but it do seem like, you know,  theirs come out a little bit more  than others  at times and stuff like that.
What do you- what do you even think,  just if you had to  take a stab at it, is the reasoning  behind  all of that?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
That's- um,  that's interesting that you said the- the two-eighty-five thing cause, um,  um, somebody  sent me, um,  a couple of tracks of their music,  wanted me to engineer it and whatnot.
Um, Um, I said I'll check it out.
Really didn't have time to, but I l- I let him know.
But, um, as I'm checking out the music,  um, I'm giving  them my little feedback  or whatever.
And basically  word for word this is what I said.
Checked out all the tracks,  and they sound good.
You're talented.
My only critique from you  from what I heard  is that  it sound like you haven't spend a day outside of I-two-eighty-five.
And bruh laughed.
He was like, appreciate it.
I'm- I'm tryna work on that,  you know.
But, um,  which it's nothing wrong with that, but, you know.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
They don't, but they- that's as Atlanta as it gets.
Mm-hm.
Dungeon Family.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Nah, I- I- I definitely definitely agree on that.
You know,  um,  I like to say,  you know, people been Atlantanized  for real for real, especially just all over the world.
Do you feel like, um,  the influence of the music alone  is affecting,  you know, the people around in the area that talk this way, or do you think it's the people around this area talking of- this way that affected the music  to be  in that type of  space?
Wow.
Mm-hm.
Ah, yeah.
Mm-hm, t- Mm-hm.
So, um,  you know,  you got a interesting, um,  job being a DJ,  and you got those feelings of what you feel like  how the music could affect people and what you like to listen to and  what they might  ha-  like to listen to.
But I guess  I don't know.
I don't wanna assume,  as a DJ  it's not about what you like or listen to.
It's about what  the people who-  what  supposed to like or whatever.
What's your thoughts on  just that in particular?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Okay, I like that.
good on that.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Sadly enough, very biased.
Um,  Childish Gambino  and  CyHi the Prynce are both  Atlanta artists, probably more so East Atlanta artists, but when I listen to 'em  and hear 'em talk,  I don't really hear,  you know, that Atlantaness.
I'm- I'm hearing like some New York type of stuff coming from CyHi.
Childish Gambino, I'm hearing just some  extra left field, that don't even sound like a nigga that coulda possibly been around the same trap area as some of these other people.
What's your- what's your  thoughts on that or just to elaborate more on that?
You gotta let me check for real .
Mm-hm.
This what's playing on nine forty-five right now.
Oh wow.
Mm.
That's tight.
It's tough for a singer out here right now  I would think.
Mm-hm.
S-  Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh man, just some-  it was a lot of ways I coulda went with that, but  I'm- I'm gonna  go down this lane with it.
Love dollars-  but how do you feel about,  um, your experience within the Black community when it comes to business and clients and  patronizing them service-wise and I guess  as far as them paying  like how they wou- I guess pay Georgia Power with the rent or  some of these other people that might not really definitely don't have no type of love for them.
What's your  thoughts?
Yeah.
Damn,  I know-  Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Wow.
You brought that shit  all the way down.
And I mean  from what I seen, it- it looks to be true  I mean I guess  I don't know.
Chick-fil-A got some good branding when it comes to that cause  everybody just know a Chick-fil-A got some good ass service.
But I mean,  they real consistent with it,  um,  so it's not- you don't think it's more of a issue that the Black business  need to go above and beyond even more?
Or is it the fact that  the-  the ec-  the- um,  they-  Black people are setting the bar too high for other Black people  as far as  they service and stuff that they don't even give that same type of consideration  to the white  or,  you know, other categories?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And the quality.
Yeah.
Anybody.
I'm about to say, we don't even know who's actually behind there cooking that stuff.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Okay.
