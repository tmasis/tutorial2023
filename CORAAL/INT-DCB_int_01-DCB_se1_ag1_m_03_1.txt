Um, where were you born?
So tell me a little bit about  that.

And so  what neighborhood do you claim now?
Like- So  where is that?

Do that-  does that neighborhood have a name or is it  thir- just- Thirty seven.
Oh.

So you've lived in DC all your life?
Where are some other places you've been?
But you didn't live there, right?
You just visited.
Mkay.
Uh, tell me about- what schools did you go to?
You go to RD-SCHOOL-4.
What's the school right before-  which school were you at- say it again.
I didn't hear the name.
Oh, RD-SCHOOL-3.
Mm-hm.
Oh so they  closed the ninth- they closed the high school part out?
So it's just- it stops at eighth grade now?
Or did they close the whole school?
They just stopped at eighth grade?
Okay.
And now you go to RD-SCHOOL-4.
Which one?
Capitol Hill.
Do you work?
Oh, whatchu wanna do?
Okay!
That's a good-    It's a good place to start.
You gonna do it that way, RD-WORK-9?
Oh okay.
Cause you know that's not how it works right?
Oh, okay.
Good.
I'm- I'm glad as long as you know that  they not gonna, uh-  that you not gonna  get your money right at the beginning.
Um, where was your father born?
Do you know?
Not really.
What about your mom?
Trinidad.
What does your mom do?
Um,  sister, you gonna sit in the room with us?
You don't want me to?
No, I'm just asking so I'll know that- I'll just make a note of it.
Mm.
Okay.
If that's the case, we might need you to pull up a chair.
I might mic you.
Okay.
Oh okay.
Great.
Um,    I think I talk loud enough, so I'm gonna actually give you my-  my mic.
So RD-NAME-2 will do most of the talking, but if you wanna chime in,  he might want-  you- he might wanna add-  you might wanna add some details.
Is that alright?
Mm-hm.
Okay.
So  RD-NAME-2, tell me about the first house you remember living in.
Mm-hm.
Your neighborhood- S- Hi, how you doing?
Fine, how are you?
I don't know.
So, okay, tell me about the house, what you remember.
Do you remember that house?
Like, do you remember how it was laid out?
How many bedrooms?
Like, what color was your room?
Mm.
Five bedrooms.
Mkay.
And so do you remember playing outside?
Did you play in the house?
Did you have like a big TV?
Did you watch TV?
So you just like,  used the  hill to  be a slide?
Okay.
What about summer time?
You didn't go outside?
Whatchu mean you just went to a hotel?
He goes to the hotels.
So I think some of that has to do with the fact that  in our neighborhood, um,  it was no kids.
So it was more like the retired older people that have some money,  and so it was no kids in our neighborhood.
It's quiet.
Like you go outside, you hear a pin drop.
And so,  it wasn't no kids for him to play with  essentially.
And so  in order for him to have fun, my mom would just take him to like,  different hotels to go swimming, to the movies and stuff like that.
Okay.
There were no neighborhood  swimming pools, or no neighborhood  recreation centers?
It was, but at that time, growing up,  our  parent-  grandparents and mom tried to keep us away from those certain neighborhoods, so  like it was a pool not too far from Woodland, and then at, um,  where was it?
So, okay,  um,    then,  tell me about-  RD-NAME-2, I want you to tell me about like,  what you remem- like your parent-  your mom,  your grandma, your grandpa, like,  growing up like,  how do you remember that dynamic?
Or what's your fondest memory of them?
You're laughing, so something popped into your mind.
What's some things that he did?
Um,  were you really close to your grandpa?
Very close?
That was your ride or die?
Yeah.
So  what do you- what did you most like-  cause I know he passed,  so what do you remember about him most.
Like I know he was funny, but what do you personally remember about him?
And so, okay.
Um,  and what do you- what lesson did he leave?
Like what do you feel like he taught you as a man?
As a- you know, as a young man?
Mm.
He was a- he was a family man, so everything was family.
Family.
Were you all really close knit?
Yes.
But it would be just our household, so-  our immediate household.
I mean we had like our uncles and cousins, but within our house, like  very close.
Very close.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Um,  so,  let me ask you this.
Um,  have you gone back to that house?
Okay .
Oh, okay.
And when you say, um,  you just have flashbacks, but you never stop by the house.
Does the neighborhood still look the same?
Do you think it's changed based on like when you were I mean,  maybe- what?
A few years ago.
It looked the same.
The house looked the same?
It's crazy.
Alright so let's talk a little bit about, um,  your relationship with your sister.
Um, I'm'a go back in my room.
okay.
And we'll get you out of- in- in a few minutes.
she-   Well.
Um, so I know- how old- how  many years are you guys apart?
Twelve.
But almost eleven cause you're about to be- you're about to be fourteen, let's make sure we say that.
In next month- That's right.
Um, thirteen going on fourteen.
Um,  so tell me about  growing up with  a sister who was twelve years older than you.
Okay, let's go back.
She took you and enrolled you in school.
Do you feel like she was your second mama?
Oh that was your partner in crime?
Do you agree RD-NAME-3?
Yeah .
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Uh oh.
Uh oh.
It's all coming out now, grandma.
It's all coming out.
Mm.
Don't get- Okay.
Don't get-  She came- I told her she could go back until it was her turn.
She won't listen.
She gonna be laughing at us.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.
But then y'all can laugh when it's her turn.
Tell 'em about how you used to climb on the ceiling.
Oh, okay.
Oh, tell me about it.
Thank you, grandma.
I ain't even get to that part.
We'd be running through the house looking for him.
That is true.
So when you aksed like, was we close?
Like those were the things that my grandparents used to deal with.
So we don't have like the-  I wouldn't say the regular grandparents, but like, we would play hide and go seek with our grandparents.
Like, even if our mom didn't play,  it was me, my brother, my grandma and my grandfather.
Even if the kids wasn't in the house, my grandmother and grandpa would play hide and go seek with each other.
Like we could be upstairs,  and all you hear downstairs is like the room to the laundry room- like the door to the laundry room.
Like they hide doors, they locking doors.
Like, that was them!
Like running around the pool table, like that was just them.
Like it'd be no kids in the house.
We'd be like, what is all that noise downstairs?
And they playing hide and go seek.
We'd be like, what?
And then we'll eventually chime in.
But that's just how it was.
Like, it was just a fun house.
It was fun.
Let me describe so you can know how he was on the ceiling.
We had a narrow hallway.
RD-NAME-2 would take  and climb up the wall.
Then he learned how to hold himself  on the ceiling, and just stay there when we looking for him.
Who looks for the kid on the ceiling?
Do you think you were spoiled?
You still granny's baby?
Mm-hm.
Mm-  oh.

Mm-hm.
That's a grandma girl over there too.
Th- so this is Grandma- The duo right here?
