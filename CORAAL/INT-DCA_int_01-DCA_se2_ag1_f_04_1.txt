In general.
What kind of games- I mean what kind of-  After school, what are you going to do now that you didn't do before?
No I mean- Well like right now or like when you get to be thirteen.
That's good.
Okay.
Uh,  here's a more kind of a serious question.
So sometime you hear people that whatever gonna happen is gonna happen.
And nothing you can do about it.
What do you think about that?
?
You don't care?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Well suppose you're-  Suppose it was a little boy  that you knew or something,  and uh,  he went out  and got hit by a truck and killed.
And one person say,  well,  it was gonna happen.
It was his time.
And so he got killed.
Another person say, well he should have been more careful.
Which one would you agree with?
??
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh, you're a good thinking  girl, RD-NAME-2.
You think about a lot of things.
