Um, what's your birthday RD-NAME-2?
Okay.
Um, great.
One sixteen to be exact.
Do you remember which uh, bassinet you were placed in?
And what's your hometown?
Of DC.
Um, what neighborhood do you kind of claim as your own?
Deanwood.
And you've lived here all your life?
Um, have you lived any other places, including college?
Where'd you go to school?
And what's your current- I'm-  I'm not sure what your status is on your current occupation situation?
Okay.
And  now I'm gonna ask some- a few questions about your parents, and then we'll get started kind of- this is just a  background.
Where was your father born?
Whoa!
That's my neck of the woods!
Exit ninety nine.
Whatchu know about Georgia?
Where was your mom born?
Oh.
Okay, that's a story.
I'll get that in a moment.
What did your father do or what does he do?
So he's here?
As queen.
Mm-mm.
Are your parents married?
No clue, RD-NAME-2.
No clue.
What?
You know you didn't get that from him.
Mm-mm.
Mm-hm.
As mom.
What did mom do?
Cause I- Mom's retired now, right?
Mm, so y'all all up in DPS?
I mean DCPS.
So,  alright.
So let's- let's back up.
First of all,  Cordele and Winston Salem.
Um,  that's the seventy five eighty five corridor.
They  kind of ain't really that connected.
How'd your parents meet?
The rest- And here you are.
Um, okay.
So they met in DC.
Okay.
So how- how did mom come to- Was it like,  grandma and grandpa decided y'all was coming to DC?
How'd dad end up here?
Hm.
Wow.
Oh this was a decision he made as an adult.
Oh he didn't do this as a child.
Okay.
Okay.
Cordele?
In Cordele.
So have you traveled a lot?
Like,  have you- do you go  down South and see them?
Are you  pretty much  whatever's happening around the District that's what's happening.
Where was it?
Oh you on the committee?
You always on the committee.
You d- You- You the eternal on the committee man.
Mm-hm.
Any the committee, you the- Then with it- yeah.
After thirty years.
Mm-hm.
So, okay.
So let's go back to your childhood kind of here.
Um, do you remember your neighborhood?
Where you grew up- the house or apartment that you grew up in?
And how was like- how was-  And how many brothers and sisters do you have?
I don't think-  Are you an only child?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Which elementary school?
But I've seen Division Avenue, so I think if I just  follow that little- I probably would- Okay.
What made him so great?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Like RD-NAME-2?
That's intense.
Oh, okay.
I need you not to be six and having RD-NAME-2 or I will Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Have you gone- I don't know if he's still alive now, but have- Did you ever go back and reconnect, even after you, you know.
Mm.
That name sounds very familiar.
Mm.
Hm.
The kid, yeah.
Why did I not- Why am I surpri- or not surprised that you had a hand in that.
Like, why?
Look like.
Right.
We had a open space high school, and it was-  but- Mm-hm.
Mm.
You know.
Mm.
Why do you think it's different?
Yeah- well,  I think that's a lot of places.
Do you feel like the pride is different?
There's a la- sig- lack of- lack of?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
You didn't feel it.
Where'd you go after RD-SCHOOL-2?
No longer going rogue.
Which monologue did you do?
Mm.
My wife having some pearls.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Be.
And why you say that?
Mm.
Mm.
I'm not surprised at either of those.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Thank you.
Jesus ain't nowhere in that is he?
mm-mm.
With them loa- with them wafers.
Mm-mm.
I love you RD-NAME-2.
I love you.
Like the little people at the Metro giving out a little card.
Oh wow, you had a following.
You had to give the- Mm.
But aren't there theological- Isn't it a theological school?
That's what- okay.
Well that's more theoretical, theological as well.
Obviously.
Using people's address and stuff, right.
Mm-hm.
How'd you end up there?
Cause you wanted to be the black Baptist trea-  preacher but not really?
What color are you?
What's your second color?
Mm-hm.
Yup.
Right.
It's just the way you charge.
I think I have learned that I'm more introverted too like, extroverts really feed off people, and they need that to like, charge them whereas introverts, you can still be very- but at the end of the day you need to recharge by being alone.
And I realize I'm very much that.
Like I can be Miss sunshine at the office, but when I go home, I just need it like- I- I play my TV with like, the captions, so I can have the volume really low.
Like I don't need all that.
Mm-hm.
You reached that point.
Mm-hm.
So at RD-SCHOOL-5 you just didn't-  It's six months, first semester.
Was it?
Ish?
You are.
Oh you know I was wondering.
I couldn't quite decide.
Mm.
Cause I gotta see these people on Monday.
Hush.
Was going on on the other side of the door.
Mm.
To do.
Yeah.
So let me ask you a question.
This kind of getting off t- Do you feel like you  give that message now, like  look, do what you wanna do.
Do you but do something- but do you.
Mm-hm.
And July babies are the best.
Mm-hm.
Out.
And that's the only time you're gonna do it, when you wanna do it.
Not when everybody else says you should or whatever the case may be.
Because guess what?
They can say all you- You know, people can say, oh, you need to lose weight.
Alright, but until you want to get into the gym, until you want to eat right, you still gonna not lose weight or whatever it is that you want to do, you have- there has to be something deep down.
Otherwise, we'll find every- we'll- we'll make an excuse to make an excuse.
Until like, your just, I'm tired of making excuses.
Like, it's a waste of my time.
Mm-hm.
Wh- whatever it is.
Yup.
Mm-hm.
And- but the thing is- one thing that I think is so beautiful about your story  is  look how many people you've touched and changed like,  along the way.
The things- it was so funny I was talking to RD-NAME-3 earlier,  and  she cried  when she talked about you.
Like,  tears.
And she was just saying how much- she said the thing that made it so important for her  was when you were  interviewing her, something about listening.
And she said,  you don't know what that means when somebody just  listens.
And she said you could have said everything else under the sun but when you said that, it was done.
Ink was dry for her.
And I think that that's what is so amazing about your journey, is  how many people- how many- at nineteen oh one-  Even- not even- even before, I can't even talk about that, but over the last three years that you've been here,  how many kids' lives have you changed  drastically, for whatever path they may have been on or whatever pa- you know what I mean?
Like,  oh no, Mr.
RD-NAME-2, it doesn't matter if Mr.
RD-NAME-2 had a two point three but Mr.
RD-NAME-2 said, I need to go to college.
Or Mr.
RD-NAME-2 said, I need to have a job.
And how many of them went to get a job?
Or went to college or  you know, still tryna do what they do because Mr.
RD-NAME-2 said it.
And I think that-  you can't put a price on that.
You can't-  you can't quantify that.
You can't say, oh well, she did at this, you did that.
Yeah, but look how many people you've touched along the way.
Mm-hm.
Cause you left the teens.
You went to the little people.
That didn't work out.
Yeah, it's the grown people that sometimes you got to check more than the little people.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Amen.
Pay ain't driving you nowhere.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Get on board or get out.
Or a cancer.
Mm-hm.
I mean now you-  Do you think that's why you still- well I don't know if you single but not married?
Cause you here all the time.
You do give a lot.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
This is what you- you coming with the other eighty.
Mm-hm.
Ooh.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
So I want to ask you a little bit about community  um,  cause I feel, personally.
DC is a very unique place.
Um, especially cause you did go away to Baltimore, um, which I am realizing and I've learned that it is a very different world cause I'm thinking eight to forty five minutes away, well how different can they be?
It's a very different world, um, and people have very strong feelings about that.
So, when you were in Deanwood, that's Northeast and you  now work- and you live in Southeast, like, you don't live far from here.
How do you see the community like,  the people,  like, how the city's changing.
How do you  see that and then how do you feel about it?
The little s- with the hole and you put the finger in it.
Mm-mm.
So it was a sense of- it was concern, yeah.
Why?
Where'd that beef come from?
Like, cause I've heard you talk about this before but I didn't realize it was like, too- like, I didn't realize- I knew, but I didn't know.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Do you have kids from both?
Like,  is the Club kind of a neutral ground or is- is it like exclusively serving one- What do you feel like is the  male-  see because Southeast, if you think about DC, it's the roughest part of the- the city-  uh, that's the perception,  um,  especially Ward Eight.
Oh,  like,  you gonna get shot up if you just walk over there.
You know, if you cross that line- Um, what do you think is the perception or what does it mean to be a black male in ward eight?
Or not even just male- I won't even just say- but to be a black person in ward eight.
In- in this time,  in DC as- as gentrification is running rampant, like  what does that mean?
Because you're from Southeast?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Doing a lot, going through some things.
Okay.
Um,  so continue on.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Mm.
That's right, mm-hm.
So let me ask you this because especially- I don't know a lot about,  mm, that's not true.
But I don't have the-  the d- I'm a southern girl, you know.
Um,  I know  about sitting on the porch shelling peas like, you know?
But that's- that's- so if somebody asked me about  what was it like growing up in the South, and  you know, some of the racial tensions that I felt in the South  that were still very alive, even covertly.
Like, very much running deep.
I can talk about that, but I can't talk about DC in that way.
What do you feel like-  so that was on the flip s- um, that was on one side.
Like,  being in DC and the perception that it's dangerous and- I mean it is.
There are some parts,  but that's anywhere.
But let's take it on the flip side,  how do you feel like-  I won't just say your men, your young men, but all your kids were affected by all of the events,  Ferguson, Eric, all that, like  how do you feel like your kids were affected  when all they could see were  like,  kids that look like them getting shot, getting killed, Trayvon Martin, like that whole-  Once that kind of- the ripple of, I think,  starting with Trayvon like, kind of,  and starting that whole eighteen, twenty four month period of just ridiculousness.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Feeling that.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Um,  so I'm'a just- I'm'a change it totally, lighten it up a little bit.
Um, what do you do for fun?
Cause I know you spend a lot of time at nineteen oh one and dealing with the goings ons of Boys and Girls- What do you do for fun?
What do you do to let your hair down?
Mm.
I don't want to hear it.
Um, w- uh, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Any line of the hymn.
Mm.
Mm.
Are you a go go fan?
Who's your favorite group?
Let's talk about go go because go go is a very- it's a- but it's a very DC thing.
There's no go go in like, Iowa.
Mm.
We'll have to do that one then cause I- I don't know if I've heard it.
I got a glimpse of that at the circus.
Yes, mm-hm.
RD-SCHOOL-2 changed your life.
Mm-hm.
Mm, yes!
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Nowhere else.
Mm-mm.
What is- what is- okay.
Let's go to mumbo sauce,  cause I hear-  you know I am going to try to some at some point.
I really am.
Um, I don't know when that's gonna be Um- Mm-hm.
Mkay.
Alright.
Right it's like-  I think I had have it but didn't know that's what I was having.
It's like a sweet hot  something.
Mm.
What- where do you- where do you eat?
Where, like-  where do you get  said mumbo sauce?
Little hole in the walls.
Mm.
But carry out means something different, right?
But it's not just Chinese food.
Mm-hm.
And I can get my steak and cheese.
I can get fried shrimp.
I can Mm.
Okay so how do I sound like  authentic DC when I order me some mumbo Sauce.
I mean-.
Five wings and fries.
Ketchup, mumbo Sauce, salt and pepper.
But do I really need the ketchup if I'm'a got the mumbo sauce.
But see now- now, wait a minute now, cause I've seen the kids when I was at Clubhouse Two.
This is when I first started working so I had no clue- cause in college I didn't know about mumbo Sauce.
I knew a little bit about go go, couldn't stand it.
So I- every day, there w- it was this little  joint like,  down the street.
And, I can't remember what-  something it was called, but they would go  before they came to the Club,  and they would go  get they chicken wings and mumbo sauce for they french fries.
But they put it in everything.
At RD-SCHOOL-2.
Was that the golden years of your life?
Mm.
Mm.
Everything you can remember that was good in your life happened while you were at RD-SCHOOL-2.
Not to say other things weren't good, but that- those were golden years for you.
Loved it.
Kids know nothing about this.
Nothing.
Mm-hm.
I knew the li- I I was wondering when the librarian was gonna come in because you can't have a good school without a good librarian.
So she wasn't like the other lady.
Mm-hm.
But Miss what's name- Miss RD-NAME-1.
Mm.
Hm.
And she went.
Very quickly.
Mm.
.
Environment.
In just- Mm-hm.
If you- if you could leave- that's what I was just gonna ask you- if you could leave,  a piece of advice,  and you do this on a daily basis, but if we could sum it up, put a bow on it, you could have a piece of advice  to the young people, to the old peo- to whomever,  like in today's time, thinking about all your journey and everything that's  up to this point.
What would that piece of advice be?
Hm.
Face.
I remember-  And it's so funny you talk about create moments that matter.
Every time I wear this shirt,  I always- when I'm traveling I try to wear it.
I- I'm very intentional like, when I wear it.
But I remember one of the things  was just seeing  The Arc  filled with kids and people on a Saturday,  and I remember  the slide show.
That thing touched me in a place that I can't even really talk about.
How-  I can't talk about what that meant and how that felt.
I just felt-  I felt hurt  but I felt reverent- like I need to just-  This is a moment of reverence.
Like I need to just realize  the struggle that we've had, um, and how much we've overcome.
And I think-  I think it just kind of summed up  just-  It was so many different emotions right?
Cause you're listening to this-  this song Glory, but you're seeing these very very-  it's juxtaposed with these images of these people that are killed right?
It's just like, you're having these conflicting-  but I think about-  I think about DC.
I think about  we are in the middle- we are in the nation's capital.
We're in one of the political capitals of the world.
And I think about  what it means when you cross the river.
How much we talk about how glorious DC is,  but you can't go to wards seven and eight.
Or now we got a new- ward nine.
Cause we gotta kick our people out so we can you know, have Starbucks on every corner.
Mind you I do drink a lot of Starbucks.
But like I remember that moment.
And as I think back,  and when I wear this shirt, I think about- Like I think about those images, and I think about  that room being  dark.
And I think about seeing the stage, and I think about just like, oh my God.
Very much so.
Have you seen Inside Out?
You have to see it.
The little animated video but it's the- it's the voices in the little girl's head?
When I was watching it, I thought of a couple different things.
I thought about RD-NAME-3,  and I thought about this journey that we've been on the last six months.
But I thought about,  like when the girl lost her joy and- and all this that goes on in the movie, right?
And I thought about-  I was that one thousand worth, and then today we talked about that.
And I said, you do- cause she was- she's reading something some poetry, and we talked a lot about eyes, and I said,  I said, why do you talk about the eyes so much?
And she said, cause they're the window to the soul.
She said,  you can- you can say a lot with your eyes without saying.
You can say so many things with your mouth but your eyes tell it all.
And that is so true.
Like, you can talk to somebody for hours and hours and hours and they can be saying all this.
And you see pain in their eyes.
You see hurt or apathy or just  sadness.
And it's just like- Mm-hm.
Whole body.
Your whole body needs to be in that thing.
Yes.
Mm.
Yup yup.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Critical.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
It's just means to whatever the end is.
