You live in- Okay but that's not your childhood neighborhood.

So,  did you play a lot-  okay but how- how big is the age  gap between like, you and  the next child that lived in the house with you?
Okay, so obviously  there was some time in between.
So did you play with other kids in the neighborhood?
Who was your best friend?
Or every day.
Some little kids, oh that's my best friend today.
So tell me what you did around the neighborhood.
Was your neighborhood safe when you were a little kid?
Did you ever feel threatened or were you always just like,  this is my neighborhood they not gonna bother me?
Hm.
Um, so what happened when like, people who weren't necessarily like- Let's say your friends wanted to come over or like, family member that didn't live in that neighborhood, or if they did- you know, they were new,  or friends or whatever, how would-  you know,  would they feel safe coming over would-  would you have to like be like, nah he cool, she cool?
So if they were a high- like, outsiders like it was just like, oh nah you can't come in?
Like, what happened- Mm-hm.
Mm.
So let's talk about your family cause it was three generations of you, it was you, your mom,  your  grandma, right?
So,  tell me about like, living  with your mom and your grandma, but also like family traditions that you guys may have had.
And so,    um,  when-  how long did this take?
I got the goods.
Okay.

So what about the rest of-   what about the rest of your family?

So what happened?
What happened when another little  baby came on the scene?
So you were twelve?
So he's a young teen.
Okay.
Oh, so he just became a teenager.
So he's smelling himself.
What kind of things does he do to get on your nerves?
So tell me about your little sister.
You'll have a roommate.
But she won't be your child because she's gonna be your little sister, so you're gonna let her do things that your mama wouldn't let her do.
Do you feel like it's- you- you said it's changed, how do you feel like it's changed since you were a kid versus like  now, twelve years later when they're,  you know, pre-teen, teen.
Mm.
Mm.
Why do you say that?
Mm.
When'd you work for mental health?
Mm-hm.
So, before I- cause I wanna ask you about working here, cause it's different being a member here, working here, and then having your siblings here.
but before we do that I wanna go back to- to your childhood, to school.
Cause I know you said  you went to a different elementary school.
How was your- like,  bring-  going through the school system?
You know, everybody was talking about DC has like bad schools and blah blah blah and-  How was school for you and what did you feel like as you were going through  elementary school, middle school, and then we'll talk about high school.

So what did you do?
Mm.
And graduated.
Did you have a favorite teacher?
So,  I didn't know you write  poetry.
I think I was out of town.
I wanted to come but I wasn't here.
Why don't you share your poetry?
I appreciate her taking that leadership to- you know, because she was out.
I appreciate that.
You have to- that's-  create- okay.
For the kids.
So let's talk about f- h- So you said you were a club kid  because you lived in this neighborhood,  or you lived not far from here when you were younger, right?
And what was that experience like?
Mm-hm.

What about Keystone?
So you just went- so now this is- you just came back from the national Keystone conference but not as a  Keystoner, as an advisor, how was that  on the other side of it?
Mm.
So we're gonna switch gears.
Um, we're not gonna talk about the- the club as much now.
Um,  but let's think about just DC.
You've grown up here all your life,  You've  pretty much explored every quadrant it sounds like,  except maybe Southwest.
Are they different?
Are the areas very different?
Like how?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
So before we get to you- time to move,  has there ever been a time you felt like-  You were just talking about things being,  you know, dangerous crime and stuff.
Have theres- have there ever been a time where you felt like,  oh my god, I'm gonna die, something's gonna happen to me.
So you've never left the city, do you wanna leave one day?
Why?
Mm-hm.
What are some places on your list?
Yeah cause I don't think it snows a lot in Seattle but I think it's a lot of rain.
What do you like to do for fun in DC?
Like where do you like to hang out or what do you like to do?
Where are the happening spots?
Mm.
We are very similar in that way.
I can sit at home and be so happy.
So now th- H Street and U Street, those are two areas that have changed a lot.
What do you think about them?
Or have you- have you- have you  witnessed the change?
Well, I guess in your lifetime they've done a lot of changing.
How has that been for you?
What does that  look like?
Or what has it looked like?
Hm.
Have you been to any of the other new locations?
Like K Street, the one over in, uh,    where is it, it's not Laurel, Hyattesville I think?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Is that your favorite grits in town?
