So now, gonna ask you just a  few questions.
Um.
Can you tell me a little bit about kind of just your  like the very first  home and neighborhood that you remember.
Where it- mm-mm.
So where's that?
By the airpo- okay.
Um, so tell me about the house.
Was it a big house, little house?
About three rooms, and it's you, your mom.
Said this is you- how many brothers do you have?
Okay, so but this was- there was only two of y'all at the time.
Okay.
Are you the oldest, or second?
Oh, so you're the big brother.
And so then, you guys moved here.
Was-  did you guys move to this place because it was bigger?
Or.
There you go.
Affordability.
That's probably the- the- the the more appropriate word there.
Um.
And then, tell me about the neighborhood.
Was it a good neighborhood?
It also makes a difference.
Um.
And so then,  when you moved there, you were how old?
Three?
And then, how long did y'all stay in that house?
And then where'd y'all go?
So,  out by  Clyattville?
Okay.
The other.
Oh, I'm going the other way.
Okay.
So you was that way.
Mm-hm.
Um, and how long'd y'all stay there?
And then where'd y'all  move to?
Mm-hm.
And why was that called Little Miami?
Oh.
Was it a lot of kids in the neighborhood?
So, were you- did you play outside a lot?
Did you.
So, what'd y'all do while y'all were outside?
Like what games did y'all play?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Did you jump rope?
Were you good?
So, that means you weren't that great.
Oh, okay.
So you were alright, you were great.
So, then, okay, so tell me about your siblings.
Okay.
And so, all of y'all played together even though with the age difference?
Or did.
So, let's talk about school then.
Um, because since you knew a lot of kids in that group, which school did you go to when you were younger?
So sorry.
Sorry that that happened to you.
To the first grade.
Mm-hm.
So which school was- which- when you came back to the city, where did you.
Okay.
And then, um, how was it?
How was school?
How- was it  good?
Did you feel like you were getting a good education?
Right.
Right  Cause she really helped.
So, you went to South Street, then where'd you go?
So, how  how long- how many grades was that?
Okay.
So, you went there?
And then?
Did it s-  so.
Okay.
So, what- what happened whe- at that time?
The integration?
Was it.
How was it?
I mean, did you  notice anything?
As like- I mean you were still like  relatively young, but like.
So you were old enough to understand.
Did it-  was there any feelings?
Like, was it  tension?
How um,  how were the  wait.
Wait.
Let me back up.
So, this was the first time, so when you went to South Street and South East, that was all black?
And then, when you go to junior high, that's when  that's when they integrated the school, so then there were white students?
Did you find that the quality of the school was different?
But, the materials the access that you had to things.
Was it better now that y'all were integrated?
Or was it about the same?
Hm.
Home.
Mm-hm.
And then, you went there for  what grades is that?
Seven and eight.
And then high school.
Mm-mm.
Black and white?
Okay.
So, how was  Pi- I've never-  that's interesting.
How was Pinevale when it was  just ninth grade?
Um.
So, was it- every- y'all did-  did y'all do like everything that you would do in high school but just,  just  in ninth grade?
So, who'd y'all play against?
The ninth grade- Ah.
Oh, okay.
Cause I was like who y'all playing against?
Okay.
So,  did you play any sports?
Oh, what position?
Shooting or point?
Were you good?
Like jump rope decent?
Oh, yeah, you were pretty good.
Okay, so then how did you- what happened when you transitioned to  the big  s- high school?
Oh.
So, you wanted to work?
How long did it take you to save to get your car?
So, how young were you when you started  doing tobacco in the fields ?
Oh, we don't have that today.
So,  so, you did that every summer?
And you-  now, how much money would you make?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Now, how long did that whole process take to  do from stringing it up to.
Mm-hm.
I have never heard this.
And so, hw many barns wha- like, cause clearly, this- you have to have a lot of.
Oh.
Okay.
Hm.
Gotcha.
Mm-hm.
And how long- how many.
So, you said you started when you were about seven eight  for the lady.
But, ho- how did you do this all the way until you graduated?
Got your car?
After school.
But what'd you do in the summer?
Oh.
Why did you work so much?
Hm.
So it wasn't just because you wanted to, it was really out of necessity at this point.
Okay.
That makes sense now.
So, Did you get the car?
And when'd you get the car?
What kind of car did you get?
And how-  how m- how much was it?
Brand new?
Mm.
But it was brand new to you.
Okay.
So, then, tell me a little bit.
Okay, so we got all-  which I've never heard anything about.
Toba- So, that's really interesting.
So, now, tell me about the rest of high school.
So, you worked.
So, you didn't do a lot of stuff in school outside of going to school.
And then go work your eight hours.
Mm.
That's That is like that's amazing.
Um.
To hear that  amount  one,  that he admitted that he didn't have a degree, or di- you know, didn't have his diploma.
And then, two, making sure while you getting paid, you still- he still supported to get- that's that's a big deal, like- and like you said, in nineteen-seventies.
When racial tensions were all kinds of a hot mess.
So,  then you graduated from  high school.
So, what'd you do that year?
Did you work?
Ever since.
So, let's go back cause we- that was whole lot of things you went through in that little two seconds.
That little two, two minutes right there.
Okay, so you went into the military.
What made you go into the military?
Mm-hm.
Say, when'd you go into the mili- seventy-five?
And how long were you in the military?
Four years.
Okay.
And so then, in two years, you said that's when you met your wife.
That's the wife you're- that's the only wife-  the same wife for today?
This is a different one?
Okay.
Different one.
Just kidding.
Different one.
Okay.
So, you met your wife, and then you had your first child.
How many children do you have?
You have two girls.
Okay.
So, your first daughter was born Nineteen seventy-nine.
Okay.
And then you.
Seventy eight, and then how many years is separate with your-  Okay.
And two days.
And two days.
And then, how.
So, why'd you decide to leave the military?
Cause of your family?
So,  let's talk a little bit about-  before we  finish.
Now, the mili-  before we leave the military.
Tell me a little bit about going to Texas and North Carolina.
How was it- How was it?
Where were you in North Carolina?
Mount.
Rocky Mount.
Mm-hm.
From there, okay.
So, ninety five?
Yep.
Okay.
Fifty.
Okay.
And so, you went there.
How- how long were you in North Carolina?
That was two years?
So, did you meet your wife  there?
Or in Texas?
Oh, you had already met- y'all were already married when you went into the mi- but she traveled with you.
Okay.
And so, y'all were in North Carolina.
How was North Carolina?
Hm.
And then you came back to-  after that, that's when you  then that's when You decided to leave because you didn't want to be having this remote duty.
Okay.
And then you came back to Valdosta.
And then at that point, you said, I'm just gonna  work?
And so,  what happened when you  came back, how did you- did you work your way up at RD-WORK-1?
So.
what do you ship?
What- what do you make?
Oh.
So, this is like high end stuff.
And how many people work?
And how many people work under you?
And you're like the whole shipping?
Wow.
Y'all do all the logistics of shipping?
Sound a lot of work for five people.
Oh, okay.
That's a lot.
So, who.
Okay.
So, now you've been there what, say thirty eight years?
What's your plan?
Another how many years?
And then what's after that?
Where you wanna go?
Mkay.
Why New York?
I don't like New York.
Where did you go- when you- When's the last time you been to New York?
What'd you see?
I don't care about the Yankees.
Mm-hm.
Was it good?
So, you're get around.
So, you wanna go to Hawaii.
Where's another place that you've said, you know what, when I retire, I'm going to this place?
I have been wanting to do that.
Like it's on my list.
Have you s- so, have you been out of the country?
Did you like it?
I want you to go to Cape Town.
Like, well, any part of South Africa.
But, especially Cape Town.
Amazing.
So beautiful.
You have to go.
That's a long flight though.
Mm-hm.
Go.
Go.
Mm.
That's sweet.
So,  I'm gonna repor- I'm gonna  follow up with you and see when you- make it over to Mozambique and South Africa.
It's gonna be an amazing experience.
So beautiful.
Oh my god so beautiful.
Okay.
So,  let's talk about a couple of other things.
Um.
You talked about your best friend.
So, when you were in school,  who were- did you have like a  t- close friends?
Hm.
So,  who was this friend that you met in, you said seventy-seven?
Oh.
Mm-hm.
That's right.
What do you think  mm.
Well, let's go back, since you just said that.
Has there ever been a time when you were like, oh my god, I'm going to die?
Or you felt like you were just in imminent danger?
Really?
Was there a time when you were just really scared?
Something that i-  and it couldn't not have necessarily been just like you were physically scared of something, it could have just been something that was just  emotionally traumatizing or.
Mm.
Mm.
He died last November?
So, that's still really new.
Was he sick?
Or he just.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
That happens.
It was so.
I you know, I'm doing the same kind of thing in DC, and you know in DC, there was this big drug in the eighties and nineties.
And um.
Some of the stories you hear are just so sad.
Right?
Because you want you know that people wanna do better, but then they also  this is what they know.
And so trying to balance that out, it's it's really tough.
And then just to watch it.
And I was talking to one guy and he  got AIDS because  he was really deep into the heroin game.
And  him and his brother both got AIDS at the same, like around the same time.
And his brother, he was like I'm gonna commit to doing better and the brother didn't.
So, he had to bury his brother, and I think that when you said that, it just  puts you in that  place that  you know you want something different.
But, you hav-  you have to w- they have to want it like, you can't want it for them.
And it's just- that's tough.
Um.
So, let me kind of go back.
Cause you were young enough  but o-  you were old enough rather  to understand.
Thinking about civil rights.
And, Valdosta's a little southern town.
How did you-  were you at a time when there was like the  sep-  the separate fountains and things like that?
Did you see the signs?
Or was it.
How was that?
Like what?
Was it?
The  provisional one?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Mm-hm.
It all makes sense.
Mm-hm.
Hm.
Do you feel like you've lived that if your life?
Mm-hm.
Wa- are you a big-  well, yes, cause I know, cause you come from church, but I'm gonna ask you anyway.
Um.
Are you a big church,  religious, spiritual person?
Did you grow up in church?
Um.
When did we meet?
I think I was.
Maybe.
When I cause when I moved here, my mom didn't move here yet.
Mm-hm.
Um.
Mm.
It may have been like fifth grade.
Mm-hm.
Cause I moved here in the fourth grade I going with my  grandma, but we didn't go as often, and then when my mom came,  we went all the time.
So, yeah.
Probably fifth grade, so it's been a long time.
Um.
I just remember  um,  what that your- what was your home church?
Okay.
Mm-hm.
And the how'd you end up at Antioch?
Oh.
Okay.
Well, that's an- and then now where do you go?
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Um.
Couple last, last couple questions for you.
Um.
If you could leave one piece of advice, to anyone,  it could be  to your kids, it could be just any, some youth, it could be just anybody.
What would that piece of advice be and who would you leave it to?
Mm-hm.
Like if-  if everybody  applied that  I think we would be in a very different situation.
