Mm-hm.
Amazing.
How old are they?
Okay.
The one I met.
That's great.
Um,  okay, so I'm interested in kind of your memories as a kid of the neighborhood.
It sounds like you  were here and you left and you came back, and so you probably have a really interesting perspective.
What do you remember?
What are some of your first memories about being here, living here?
Yeah.
Right.
What- what was the rest of the make up, at the time?
It was?
Uh-huh.
Wow.
They weren't, and now even if there- you were one of the only black families you didn't feel any.
Didn't care?
That's great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Yeah, so where did you play it?
Yeah, you played on- on the block?
Wait, is Johnny on the Pony the one where everybody jumps On s- a person's back.
I've heard of this.
I'm like, this sounds not fun for people on the bottom.
That's inaudible.
What?
I've never heard that one.
Now were boys and girls, were you playing together as a kid?
That's cool.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right, right.
Right.
Oh my God.
Do you have good memories of a, kind of  being a kid and playing and  friends and things like that?
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
As you got older, you- Oh, that's good.
That's nice.
So as you got older,  I-  now at this point you were- Oh, that's convenient.
Oh, really?
Didn't have a good rep?
Was it- was it true?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
I get it.
Okay.
Yeah.
S- yeah.
So was your mom a strict mom?
Was she lenient?
Like, were you allowed to explore and- she was strict.
So you kind of had to stay close to home.
Wow.
Wow.
No past Avenue A, you mean east?
So not to Avenue D?
Couldn't do it.
Wow.
Did you ever do that?
Or were you- You were that rebellious.
Right.
Wow.
That's so funny.
Because the black kids lived on Avenue D?
So once-  so once- yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
So once you went to junior high then you realized.
Yeah.
You're like, look at that.
So that was a different experience, then, I bet.
On the Ave.
Had a attitude?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was nice when it was built.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's  funny.
Well, what about high school?
Were you still in the neighborhood?
Okay.
Oh.

Oh, I didn't know that.
These were public schools?
But they were just all girls?
Mm-hm.

Then s- and so then what did you do after high school?
Yeah.
Okay.
So you commuted?
Yeah.
That's- that's far.
Okay.
Oh.
Right, cause that would've-  yeah.
That affects your rent.
Yeah.
Cool.
How was that?
Yeah, now why did you not- is- you did not wanna stay in the neighborhood at the time?
Oh, you were working in Harlem.
So now, at this point, did you s- you stopped going to  school?
You're working- you were working full time.
Mm-hm.
That's great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
That's great.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
How was that?
Wow.
That is really something.
That's un- Right.
Right.
So you spent like a total of eight, ten years away from the neighborhood?
Cause you were in Harlem- Harlem, and then Queens.
And then you came back when your mom passed away.
Got it.
Got it.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
How did that feel?
Did it- did you wanna come back?
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
That's a lot of responsibility.
Oh my gosh.
Oh no.

What were you working- doing for work at the time?
That's pretty good for that time.
Yeah, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.
And you- and did you end up  taking the landlord to court?
Oh  god.
That's terrible.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, no.
So you're working as a case worker, you said, how long did you do that?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Uh-huh.

Oh my gosh.
I'm so sorry.

Are you  feeling- doing better now?
You look picture of health.
I'm surprised to hear that.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.
Now you're back at working.
And you- what are you doing now?
Oh, right.
Right.
When I call you, that- I n- I knew- I knew you worked for them.
But you are on site somewhere else in Brooklyn?
Yeah.
That's great.
How do you like it?
S-  working them all.
Yeah.
That's nice.
That's great.
Good life history.
I think we've hit everything, I think.
Um,  so let me ask you some of your opinions about the neighborhood.
I mean, you've-  you've come and gone so many times in your life.
How do you see these great changes that have happened?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
And you still feel that?
That that exists today?
That's great.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
In your mind.
Yeah.
Planning not to stay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right, right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now there's a couple of periods that a lot of people talk about, I'm just curious if you see these as periods or experience that, but you know, the seventies and eighties as being kind of a period where there was  a lot more crime.
And there was-  there were drugs in the neighborhood.
Is that something that  you experienced yourself or saw, you feel is still the same or different?
Yeah.
If, uh, you went to the Ave.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
Really?
This was you said, nineteen eighty-five?
Really?
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
Did you ever have any bad experiences, um, muggings or, you know.
Did you ever feel scared?
Right.
Yeah.
Really, that few?
I'm surprised.
Oh, okay.
Are you okay?
Yeah, d- don't worry about it.
Do you- No, that's okay.
Do you want me to get you some water?
Feel free to, um, yeah.
The clip, no worries.
I'll just pause it.
No, I'm fine.
Thank you so much.
Is that r- true?
S-  is that, I mean- That's so funny.
And so what's the make up here then?
Huh.
Oh.
Is that- I mean, that-  that  doesn't seem right.
That's- that's terrible.
Um, okay so- so you did sort of see some of the  sort of quote unquote bad period.
I mean, did- has it seemed to get better as you've noticed?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, so you've experience first hand that  influence that the drug scene had.
And- and has it decreased?
I mean,  do you- oh.
Huh.
Right.
Okay.
So many.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
Now, are the people that are spilling out onto the street, are these like, the working folks that you've been talking about, or?
Yeah.
Oh they drive out.
That's terrible.
I mean, you're sort of speaking to the, sort of, other  s-  period or force that I was gonna ask you about, which is the-  the idea of a- the Lower East Side as,  you know, getting gentrified.
And if there's all these,  you know, wealthier folks moving in, white folks moving in.
I mean, that's a little- a little more reason- recent.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Right.
And it was so mixed.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And- and so the change now then, is just people with- in general, people with money.
And it's trendy, like the bars and restaurants like you were saying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
What is it?
Oh, no.
Oh, I've heard of it.
Yes.
Yes.
What?
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, that- yeah.
How does that- what do you think about this  change and the big hotels going up and some of the- the- some of this money coming in?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah, I've .
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hm.
Yeah.
Did they?
Yeah.
Oh my gosh.
That's terrible.
On the block.
That's a lot of bars.
Um, I'm curious what, uh,  if I asked you, like, define geographically what the Lower East Side is for you?
Because a lot of people have different, uh,  a different  definition of what makes up the neighborhood.
What is it for you?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, is that a community to you?
I mean, um, I mean I guess to answer that, like, what- what is a community to you?
Like, what does it mean for people who live in a place to be a community together?
Oh.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
So, I mean, is there like a Low- one Lower East Side community?
You know, we're talking about these people coming in.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
East Village, yeah.
Yeah.
The East Village.
Yeah.
To you it's the Lower East Side?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
So it's a big area for you.
And you did talk about, you know, the i- this sense- a sense of community with the people with you still know, that you grew up with and stuff.
And so it sounds like maybe what you're saying is  the whole- the neighborhood as a whole  doesn't feel like a community, but that the people that you know maybe form like a smaller, you know,  community within a community.
That you say you still feel- you d- you-  you did say that, right?
That you d- d- you do feel a sense of community, still.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Just keeping up the struggle.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a tough question.
Um, I- a m- more positive question.
Uh, what are some  places in the neighborhood that are especially important to you?
Like, a place could be, you know, ar- a-  your house or a park or a restaurant or- or where are places, like, in your life that  really stick out as important in the neighborhood?
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, did- did you play there a lot?
I-  Th- the Oh, they'd set up the tents and they- the riots and stuff?
Right, right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
