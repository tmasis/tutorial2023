So when you moved to Valdosta?
So I think we moved- what was it, nineteen ninety-four?
Okay.
When  was it clearly?
Oh wait w- w- wait- before- before- wait- before we- Right.
But before we moved to Valdosta- hold on, before we come to Valdosta I'm gonna ask you two things.
One, rem- church, and then I have another question.
Tell me a little bit about church.
Mm-hm.
Oh did you know Lynn getting married?
Yeah, mama said no.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
In a month.
Mm-hm.
Little Lynn Donna.
Mm-hm.
I was always wanting to play with her baby doll, I mean her Barbie Doll.
Um.
But then-  I just- The only-  I mean I remember a few of your girlfriends, but the one I remember the most, who I loved the most  RD-NAME-4.
Didn't she end up going to Spelman?
Not surprised.
Have you  talking to her-  have you talk- have you spoken with her at all?
At their old house phone number?
Oh that was really sweet.
I just m- I don't know, I just always-  I think because I wanted, I l- I looked up to her.
I wanted to be  RD-NAME-4.
Like I just  always thought she was just the bee's knees.
Mm.
Didn't she have a- did she what- did she have a red car?
No that wasn't her.
Hm.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, okay so then we moved- Okay so I moved- You- That's right- you went to Thomasville first with Aunt Sue.
And Uncle James.
And I moved to Valdosta.
Um.
So how was Thomasville?
Did you make the football team?
So what happened when you moved to Valdosta?
And so then we so- when your m-  So that was- you talking about- So then we moved into the h- we moved to the house next door.
Cause we weren't living with-  We were- This is when your mama came right?
Mm-hm.
So what do you think, if you hadn't moved back to Valdosta do you think your life woulda been different?
How?
Okay, so what happened after high school?
No I'm- I'm- Was that the last time you got in trouble?
And what year was that?
Mm.
I think that's when we stopped talking.
Why?
What did she say to you?
Do you remember the moment that changed our relationship?
After the whole gated community thing?
What was the moment that changed our relationship?
Do you remember what happened?
You remember-  I will alw- you called me on September first.
Because you- you couldn't call my phone.
And so your whatever your little counselor whatever, she let you call me on September first and you asked me how I was doing.
And my water had just broke and I said well, my water broke, you know.
And I was due in December.
I had been in the hospital.
I think your mama had told you I'd been in the hospital the whole time.
And RD-NAME-3 was born the next day.
And I did something else I said I would never do.
Mm-hm.
Mm, but yeah- but she couldn't- she didn't have that on- Mm, she couldn't bring that in.
They didn't let her bring that in.
You had to hold her.
And then soon after that I think you came home.
And I think our whole relationship changed after that.
And then what happened for you after that?
And they are the best of friends.
And it's so funny cause they're almost the same age that we're apart.
So they're six years apart, and we're seven years apart.
Yeah.
It's backwards yep.
Yep.
Um.
Couple of other questions I wanted to ask you.
I'm gonna ask you  one first and then I'll ask you the other one.
So have you- Has there ever been a time where you felt like, you're like, oh my god I'm about to die, like this it,  like  my life is end- is gonna end right now.
Tell me a couple.
Like describe it for me.
Hold on let's let this plane, do extra.

When we finish I'll get you a water.
And you kind of chubby.
Hm.
I'm gonna ask you another- and this is-  this just cause I'm interested.
So,  do you remember July seventeenth,  two thousand sixteen?
Can you tell me what, like I remember,  when I called you all,  can you just kind of-  walk me through that whole-, like  I know what I was going through,  but I remember,  when I called you guys,  y'all all were in the car together.
