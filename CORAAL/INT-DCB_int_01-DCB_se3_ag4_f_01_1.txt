Um, birthday.
Mm.
I just wanted it to be kind of like,  sixty seven.
Sorry.
Or seventy eight.
But then you- Oh.
Um, and  hometown?
Which neighborhood?
Mkay.
Um, and you've lived here  pretty much all your life?
Have you lived other places even for short amount of time?
So you are like, DC.
DC.
Okay, so Where'd you go to school?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Um,  and what do you currently do?
What's your occupation?
Um, about your parents.
Is your- Was your father born here?
And what about mama?
Moved to DC.
And what about your parents?
What did they do for a living?
Mm.
Perfect.
That's all the stuff I have to-  to write down, and now we get into the- the actual  good pieces.
So,  tell me a little bit about- I know we were talking briefly about  your neighborhood  um- Was that last week?
When we set this up.
So tell me a little bit about  what you remember about your house, um, your neighborhood.
Growing up there, were there a lot of other kids?
Your family?
Mm-hm.
Huh.
Hm.
I was just going to ask.
Okay.
Go in.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm, mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I was gonna ask you about those but tell me how that f- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Seen that-  Mm-hm.
Used to.
Mm-hm.
Did the drugs come in at that point?
To- No, I love it.
Ooh.
Mm-hm.
You were very girly girl.
Mm.
Mm.
Wow.
Before Google.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
This is the RD-SCHOOL-2 campus?
The- Okay.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Mm, mm-mm.
this was the seventies- seven-  Yeah, okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Oh.
N- Northea- like Eighth Street?
that's- Down in that way- Okay.
Where you were.
Done.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
No, that's great.
The whole- The thing is- I- You know,  you experienced-  You've grown up here.
You said the farthest you've lived is Silver Spring, and that's fifteen minutes.
And so when we talk about someone- a DC native- Like, your experience- One thing that I do wanna follow up on  is kind of going back to the riots for a minute?
Because you were close enough to U Street, and like Ben's Chili Bowl, and how that was so histor- Do you remember like, kind of like,  Ben's being that landmark, and then U Street- How it was different, I wanna ask that question, and I wanna ask about Doctor King- going back- after you finish that.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Wow which one?
Mm, mm-mm.
Cation.
Okay.
Right.
Because you were talking about racial tensions?
Mm-hm.
Yep.
Mm.
self Just doing it.
Mm-mm.
So I think my second question is because- In a city-  Two-  I guess it's two parts, But, this used to be Chocolate City, right?
And now we see that it's a- One person put it as a swirl moving toward vanilla.
Um,  with the swirl part running out.
Um,  do you feel like-  I- I think  sort of, you had to justify your blackness in- in the time when being black- But do you ever feel like you-  your-  your ide- The way you looked helped you?
Like,  in a th- When there was so-  so much racial tension and racially charged where you kind of got-  kind of a pass because you looked white?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Lord and Taylor's still there.
It's ho- it's hanging on.
It's- Mm.
We are, but come on in if you need to warm up your-  Right.
Mm-hm.
Probably even more so.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
pearance So let's move away from that for a minute.
Um, because I think-  I- I think-  Cause I will come back to that when we talk about kind of gentrification and how now the city is, so we'll- we'll come back to that.
But let's talk about like, high school, um, and your friends.
So,  who'd you hang out with?
What'd y'all do?
Kind of, who was  RD-NAME-2 in high school?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right, now it's like- Mm-hm.
And you the priest's cousin.
Mm.
Mm.
Knew each other.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm, you were a goody goody two shoes.
Mm-hm.
Ah.
Naturally.
Mm.
What did you do for fun?
Like, especially that-  Like, as a teenager and a young adult, like what did you do  outside of school?
Mm.
I am not surprised now, RD-NAME-2.
That is- Nope, not surprised at that.
Mm.
You weren't a super super wild child.
And this was the seventies.
Early se- So it was like a thing.
It was a thing.
Oh, you were it.
It had a different- Yeah, it had a very different- Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yep.
Number one is number one.
I wish.
Because she didn't drive.
No, that's fine.
It's okay.
Mm.
Cross.
Mm-hm.
Didn't work.
Mm-hm.
What?
Wow.
And this is the seventies.
Or early eighties?
But seven- eleven thousand dollars c- It's a lot.
That's a lot of money.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Was a sign.
Mm-hm.
She said and the pocket protectors.
Mm.
Imaginable Mm.
Oh wow .
Suffering .
So this was two thousand two.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm Unintelligible Mm.
Mm-hm.
It's no problem.
No, this is great.
So I- I have a different- I wanna ask something totally different Um,  because yes, I know kind of your  history here, um, there's two things that I wanna ask you about.
First, before we- I wanna do a playful topic, but the other- If you could leave one piece of advice to this generation-  I won't even just say the youth, but just  to people in general,  like-  Especially the youth though, what would that piece of advice be?
Mm.
Thank you.
So  as you know, we're talking about DC.
Do you think-  Well there are two things that I- that people have told me that are unique to DC.
Go go  music and mumbo sauce.
Can you talk about your experience with either of those and how you feel about- y- those.
Okay.
Mm.
Now what- How do you define a carry out?
Okay.
Mkay.
Mm-hm.
And that's the carry out.
Now a Chinese restaurant is just Chinese food, but a carry out is a very specific thing.
Okay.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
It's two on every corner.
Mm-hm.
Not at two in the morning.
Mm-hm.
You have- Right.
But you're not trying to go to sleep.
Right.
Do you have a favorite group?
Or were you just kind of more-  You weren't like super deep into- Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Ah, okay.
Mm-hm.
