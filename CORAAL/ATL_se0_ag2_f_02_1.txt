Hello.
Mm.
RD-NAME-5.
Female.
Hm.
I'm black.
Nineteen eighty.
St.
Petersburg, Florida.
RD-ADDRESS-5.
Twenty-three years.
I am not.
My father was born in St.
Petersburg, Florida, and my mother was born in Arlington, Georgia.
The interviewer  was my old neighbor.
And now  he's my friend and producer.
Sometimes.
I make pop music and hip hop  slash rap music.
Um,  when I was a kid,  I was addicted to it.
Um,  Armed Robbery  by Eightball and MJG.
Mm yeah, one of my all time favorites.
Definitely not.
Not very inspirational.
Thanks.
Yes.
Directly before I came here, I was in Gainesville, Florida.
Definitely, um,  yeah,  I didn't wanna leave Florida.
I still wanna go back.
Can't say that I agree to that.
Um,    I ended up having children and, you know,  didn't wanna  transition them back and forth from schools, cause I  moved a lot when I was young.
And my son has cerebral palsy, so he's  in a special needs program, so kind of like to keep him where he's comfortable.
And  when he gets out of school, I'm definitely leaving.
I have four kids, two daughters and  twin sons.
Thank you.
My immediate family.
Um,  I have   five brothers that are living.
I had six brothers,  and  some of us talk more so than others.
I talk to my mom everyday.
Talk to my dad pretty often.
Of course I talk to my children every day, so  it's pretty  cool.
I mean we have our differences like every family, but  we all love each other.
Pretty close-knit.
Um, school was pretty good.
I  did really good in school.
I was all A's on the  honor society, and it was pretty much a breeze.
Um,    started skipping a lot in high school,  you know, doing  music and having fun and being the typical teenager.
And I got pregnant.
Um,  and  I'm a teen mother.
I guess  you would know that, since I got pregnant.
But I did graduate high school  in nineteen ninety-eight.
Then I went to college  for  nursing.
That's what I do.
And I'm still in college for psychiatry  cause that's what I want to do.
Thanks.
Actually I'm learning about politics right now, and I do not like politics at all.
And I'm doing Intellipaths which are questions on the politics,  and I would rather be doing anything else.
I don't have any feelings about him.
Um,  Don't really think about him.
I don't like him,  I mean-  To me, he's-  has money, but he's rather  ignorant.
I wouldn't have  picked him as a president,  or a friend,  or  an associate,  or a neighbor,  or anything.
Amen.
Hm.
Well, I'm a Christian.
Um,  I'm actually a pastor,  prophetess, so.
Not so much as religion, but I'll say I'm  big on believers cause  I go according to the bible, and the bible says don't be overly religious.
So I have morals and ethics, and I follow them.
Commandments,  you know,  I believe in God.
Jehovah Jireh, Jehovah Nissi, Jehovah Rapha,  Jehovah Shalom.
Right.
Right.
Another one?
Okay Okay.
Yes.
Um, No, because it's a lot of independency going on these days.
Um,  what really kept me from being mainstream in my music I think was really obstacles in my life.
Um, one of the main things was bad relationships.
And it kind of caused me to be stagnant or deal with jealous people or put other people on the forefront  because I tend to  have a big heart.
But, um,   no, my music is very versatile.
It's very mainstream.
Like I said, I'm not religious, so  I'm able to deliver and still have fun and not really part- feel a particular way about it.
I believe that God is my only judge, but  because I am a believer, it keeps me from getting caught up in selling my soul or doing anything just to  get higher on the music  Richter scale I guess would be the good word.
Right.
Um, hm,  who do I like music wise?
I like Missy, Missy Elliot.
Um,    who else would I like?
I like the Migos.
Yeah.
Definitely, I like Selena Gomez.
Yeah,  uh,   I like Justin Bieber.
Um,  yeah.
Yeah, I do.
I like, um,  Deitrick Haddon too, and I like, um, Yeah.
I like Lecrae.
Yeah,  it's pretty awesome.
And I love myself.
I love myself too,  okay.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Definitely.
Definitely is definitely m- my favorite word.
Um,  yeah.
I like saying please too.
Please.
Like please.
If somebody says something stupid or some BS like,  please.
Or-  yes.
Yeah.
Hm.
Physical fight?
Hm.
I don't really- Mine definitely wasn't in grade school.
It was  a few years ago.
Yeah.
I actually have fights often, but  I box, so they're planned fights.
But as far as a street fight,  mm,  yeah, few years ago.
Yes, I am.
I love boxing.
It's great.
Wrestling?
I definitely don't wanna do wrestling.
That's definitely staged.
And, um, yeah it's a lot of training in that, and a lot of times you gotta be real muscular.
It- not if you're a female.
That's definitely manly looking.
Yeah,  don't think I wanna do that.
Yeah,  I did.
I still act.
I write plays and, um,  did a couple movies, but    people are real inconsistent, and I'm not good at editing, so it kind of makes it discouraging.
But I do have a TV show that's called RD-WORK-4, and it comes on Comcast twenty-four.
Yes, definitely.
M- Dancing.
I still do that.
I have a dance school,  um, on RD-ADDRESS-3 Highway in RD-ADDRESS-3 Um,  well I do do pole dance classes and chair dancing.
But it's also, you know, hip hop dancing and,  you know, jazz and choreography type dancing.
I did do some stripper  dancing  some years back.
No, n- it's definitely not the best money.
Um, yeah, they may, but they're doing a little bit more than  stripping, or exotic dancing would be the technical term.
So  the lifestyle that comes with it definitely is not appeasing.
Mm, definitely, and bad reputations.
Mm, yeah.
You mean with the rape and stuff?
Do you think it's true?
I don't know.
I don't put  anything past anybody on that aspect because I had a kind of  bad experience with that.
So, um,  people that you would not imagine to do things like that actually could, so  I don't know.
Maybe he did.
I don't know what he did.
I'm not God, but I mean, he never did it to me.
We definitely weren't ever in the same place at the same time.
Just  I was- We definitely know that God knows.
Something's definitely going on  when he's  in court that much.
They definitely could.
I mean it's- happens a lot.
They did it with OJ Simpson, and they still talk about him and even Tiger Woods, and  I just don't understand why when one person comes forward, a whole bunch of people do.
Like if you're a serial rapist,  why don't  people find out until you're a lot older?
Very, very weird.
So are you trying to, in a sense,  keep from saying Illuminati?
Mm, okay.
Oh okay.
Hm.
I don't know.
I just think it's the world, and it's corrupt, and it's a big facade, just like this Jay-Z and Beyonce thing.
They're getting a divorce and breaking up.
Now they're having twins.
So, I don't know.
Salt in the game?
Blinders?
An illusion?
I th- definitely think it's stupid.
S-  word from me.
I think everything is staged, like all the TV shows and everything.
Definitely don't think anything is real anymore.
The food isn't even real.
Yeah.
I guess so.
I am.
That's me.
I stay in my lane.
I'm the boss of me.
I know.
What if I made a fake relationship, and we just broke up every week, and then had kids?
That really is.
I think I'm'a go for president too.
I think I'm definitely moving to another country.
Yeah, until Trump told them they couldn't come back.
Or is that just foreign people that can't come back?
I don't know, this world is crazy, like  I don't know.
I just say you have to believe in God.
So are there particular topics that we have to talk about on this interview?
Mm, okay.
Oh.
We probably definitely do.
Um, they're  probably still in there.
Definitely haven't used them.
Nah, I haven't used that camera at all.
I told you I'm not good at editing, so I'm not about to  play with my emotions.
I probably would, but I don't think it's my thing.
Dirty.
You.
Good, let's do a video.
Mkay.
Well, that's not helpful.
Circular.
So, how good are you at editing?
Is it  realistic?
Like,  we get somewhere, and  you don't know how to do it anymore?
Okay, so when does this start?
I need a video like ASAP.
I don't know.
I can look.
But that's  real old.
Who footage?
I don't even know who that is.
Can you go download my song on iTunes?
Ready Set Go on iTunes, Spotify, Amazon.
Freaknik?
Wow.
It was like a big orgy.
And Memorial Drive was packed, and it was pretty cool when it was the real Freaknik.
Yeah, that was pretty cool.
Yeah, all up.
M- Yeah, yeah,  you missed it.
They're definitely going to jail.
They shut it all down.
They don't want us to do anything in Fake-lanta.
I don't think they want us to be turnt at all unless we're gay.
Was I supposed to say that?
PC or PG?
Oh, I thought you meant PG like parental guidance.
Yeah.
Definitely don't need that right now, kind of.
Yeah.
Yeah did you know Kid 'n Play got married?
Nah, I'm for real.
Definitely look it up.
Mm-hm.
Can I google while we're on this interview?
Did Kid 'n Play get married?
It's not.
There actually- it's actually a live interview if you go on YouTube.
They're talking about it.
They're definitely serious.
Um, It definitely exists.
You can pull it up on YouTube.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
No.
No.
Befuddled.
Wha-   Did this interview just turn left?
Um, actually thankfully, I don't have any coworkers.
I'm an independent contractor.
Yes, so  I don't have that problem.
Nursing.
Yes, I do in home-  I do in home nursing.
So, um, I only work with my patients and submit my time and my task sheets, so it's pretty cool.
Yeah.
In what?
Oh,  I would say so.
Why is that?
Um, I  wouldn't say so myself.
No, think whoever  puts in the most effort  would be the ones that get it.
It's all about your grind, your hustle.
You know, what's your hustle?
Right.
Right.
Productions.
Um,  somethings you can grind longer for,  you know.
It's all about consistency I would say, what you stay down for.
Some people think it takes too long so they give up.
Just like with praying, you know.
If it doesn't happen, people lose faith, but  whatever you do, you got to stay down with it.
Cause it's probably several other people doing the same thing.
So  I would say marketing and persistence.
Because if you stay up,  then you never get any rest to recoup.
So sometimes you gotta stay down.
Mm, yeah.
Stay down for the calls.
I definitely don't.
I love sports, but as far as favorites, I wouldn't say.
I could say my least favorite is the Falcons.
What if they would have won the super bowl?
They- they're still my least favorite.
I just don't like them.
I haven't-  I don't- What does that kind of person look like?
Mm.
Yeah, I'm definitely not from there.
But I did get pregnant there.
They definitely don't, because the Saints and the Falcons are always at odds.
My sons are actually Saints fans.
Think it's because of their dad.
But they have been saying rise up all week.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, they always do that.
Kind of used to it.
Yeah,  aren't you from Alabama?
Mm, yeah.
I like when the Gators win too,  or the Dolphins, or the Jaguars.
Mm-hm,  that's not good.
Dubai.
I definitely wanna move to Switzerland.
Sure.
Yes,  diamonds imported from Switzerland.
Yeah.
You know in Dubai if you're gay they kill you?
S- It's definitely illegal.
Yes.
I'll do it.
Don't worry.
Where's my phone?
s- Yes.
It sounds gay a little bit.
Dubai.
Is being gay illegal in Dubai, Africa?
Hm.
Hm.
Kay.
What's so great about America?
What?
Like them saying Christopher Columbus discovered something that was already discovered?
Hm.
What about the Empire State Building?
Mm.
Those flying nuclear bombs on that.
Mm,  it blew up,  same as a bomb to me.
Oh yeah that.
You can tell I don't like it.
Americ- Mm.
M- Kay.
Hm.
A- have you been to Africa?
Oh great.
Oh great.
M- Mm,  yeah.
I'd like to go to Africa.
I really want a giraffe.
We should get one.
I think they're v-  big whether they're a baby or grown.
Just assuming, you know.
I think about that a lot.
Yeah.
I definitely want a elephant.
You know RD-NAME-2's neighbors have a horse in their backyard.
It's a big h- grown horse in a little gated fence.
i- Their backyard is actually smaller than this.
Mm, yeah.
Not in backyards.
Glad that's your topic of discussion.
So remember that dog you had a few years back?
Wha- A- I don't even know.
I lost count.
I had Sheena, Sheebra, um, then I had Caino,   uh,  Saint P.
I've had a lot.
I can't even remember.
Probably about twenty.
You're right.
How many dogs have you had?
Mm, I find that to be not true.
What about Red?
Skate right around that, huh?
Mm, alright.
Does it?
Right, when you talk about Red.
Does that mean it's not recording anymore?
Oh, what kind of phone is it?
I see.
Why is it so confusing?
Oh, there it is.
Not a problem.
Awesome.
