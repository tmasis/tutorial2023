And when is your birthday?
And where were you born?
And what neighborhood did you grow up in?
Okay, and so  this was North  West.
Okay.
Shaw is- I'm still tryna get that neighborhood cause I don't know that neighborhood very well.
And um, have you lived in other places outside of  DC?
Mm!
That is great.
We don't have- We have some, but usually like- The one I interviewed the other day, he had lived in  um-  He lived in DC all his life for- except like three years, he lived in Baltimore.
Or you know, so most people-  I had one lady, she lived all her life, and then she  left to go to college and she-  After six months, she came back and then she went to UDC.
So  e- It's-  I've gotten some luck- I've gotten lucky with some, but sometimes you don't see a lot that  done everything- Mm-hm.
Okay, where's- Okay, that's a good- Where's mom from?
Oh!
I lived there for a few months.
And dad is from DC?
So she's kind of from DC.
She's not-  Do-  That's not from DC?
You didn't- Before you could say you were from DC?
Wow.
And what did your m-  fath- father do?
Hm.
Gotcha.
And where- What about mom?
And what did she do?
She- Mm.
And how-  Now because that was- So that was like the forties and fifti- That was- fifties.
So,  do you- do you remember your mom either telling you a lot of stories?
Or do you remember like,  seeing your mom, especially because racial tensions in the city at that point- even now, but I think  especially as we are getting to the Civil Rights era,  how do you feel like, with her being  The Help as you-  as you said  that- Mm-hm.
And that was your neighborhood-  Think about back then.
Were you-  First of all, are you a only child or do you have siblings?
Mm.
The knee baby.
Mm.
So in your neighborhood- Okay, so did y'all play together?
Were y'all close in age enough that y'all played together, and were there a lot of other kids?
Mm.
I hear that a lot.
Mm.
I'm not sure what that is Do you remember a time when  you felt like the neighborhood shifted?
Or had you moved out by then?
Bother you.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And how did- What did- What did she do?
Oh!
Okay, we're gonna have to back up.
That was a lot of jump.
Hm.
I'm just gonna unclip this.
I think it will be easier for you.
That way you don't have to- Mm-hm.
Right.
Mm.
You tell- I'm-  I'm enjoying it.
So as much as you wanna share.
Mm-hm.
And how old is your older sister- How many years are y'all apart?
Oh, gotcha.
Okay.
Mm.
Mm.
So you was- gonna say something.
Mm.
On to each other.
So how old were you when you got married?
August tenth is an important date for you.
And- But it's good.
You can remember everything in one day.
You don't have to forget anything.
It's all one day.
So did you move out?
Or you still at home?
How- How did that- I don't- At thirteen.
And so while you were- I'm gonna just put this back in front of you.
Just- I think it's me.
But while you were- Okay.
So,  you were thirte- so seventh, eighth grade.
Then you went to-  Did you go to high school then?
And still work, and still be a mom to two little ones.
Mm-hm.
That should be alright.
Go ahead.
No- Oh, it's fine.
Right.
Baby children.
Not even like, toddler toddlers.
A kid.
Mm-hm.
And this is in the early seventies.
In DC.
Soon after Martin Luther King.
Mm-hm.
fro- Mm-Hm.
You had enough going on without all- Right.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.
And that neighborhood has changed so much.
Fourteenth, Girard, that's- Columbia- You in the heart of Columbia Heights.
And so how long- You- you stayed there for- That was RD-NAME-3's childhood home cause I remember her telling me about- Mm.
Mm-hm.
It was ten blocks?
Fifteen bl- Not- Ten.
It wasn't that far.
Mm-hm.
Teenth Street.
Mm-hm.
You just made it work.
So what did you do?
Wait, did you fini- Wait.
Before that, did you finish high school?
You were still in high school at this point.
Okay.
At this young age?
Like you just walked out a hospital and went to work?
Pretty much?
Wow.
Mm.
But that was- Your focus was surviving and- and making a life.
And not even thinking about it.
Just doing what you got to do to make it.
Especially in the neighborhood in- Fourteenth Street- That became a big- Mm-hm.
And when did you leave-  When did you leave there?
So you stayed- That was a- That was a long time.
And then that's when you guys moved over to Southeast?
And tell me what that experience was like.
Cause now, you're- you- your kids are much older.
But it somehow got paid.
And you wanted your kids to feel differently or have a different experience.
Mm.
Once you guys got older.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Why?
Mm- Mm-hm.
And that was kind of-  You feel they filled your- the maternal role for you?
Mm-hm.
You just do.
Why?
Because you felt-  Even with Miss RD-NAME-3?
Was it Miss RD-NAME-3?
Was that her name?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Doing the manicuring of the lawn.
Mm-hm.
Miss RD-NAME-3.
I mean that's a lot going on.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Oh, okay, cause I was gonna ask you what was that.
Gotcha.
Okay.
No, please.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Oh.
Uh- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Kids.
Mm-hm.
Do you feel like you had to  um-  But it was never- You were n- It was never a welfare program.
This was always just other help- other people helping you.
With it.
Mm-hm.
Do you feel like there was ever a point- I guess, especially like, moving to Southeast because that's a different-  People have a lot of different perceptions about Southeast.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Cause Northwest is a long way from Southeast.
Especially as a kid.
Yeah.
House.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Hm-mm.
Where'd you go?
Mm.
Right.
Mm.
Mm.
Have it.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Do you feel like now that's even more so?
Mm.
Do you feel like DC like- Cause of- You know, it's changed- And when- And that changed you?
Mm.
And that was -Especially in Northwest, right?
Because that's- that's right away from  the Cap- I mean, it's cl- it's far enough away from the Capital so they could be away, but it's close enough they could .
Mm-hm.
You feel like even within  the black ra- mm.
And why do you say that?
And you still hear now.
That is not- I'm not surprised.
Mm-hm.
Do you think that made difference like- in your resour- Like, the access you had to resources, and like, your experience,  not even just within your own community, but I'm just saying navigating the city.
Mm-hm.
And she was black?
I mean no, the teacher was black?
Now did you go when it was separate campuses or when it was the  RD-SCHOOL-2 campus, or did you go when it was like, in different parts of the city?
Mm, right, okay.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Cause it felt like profess- It wasn't like, people right out of high school.
It wasn't your traditional college student.
What do you think is your most influential or your favorite book?
And it could been that you read during that time- Which one?
Cornel West?
Did you see him just recently?
He was at uh, Howard?
He's insightful.
He makes you- He incites emotion.
Have you read most of his stuff?
It wasn't about the checking and savings account.
It was just tryna get to the next day.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And you cared about what things looked like.
It wasn't just any kind of way.
Thing.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Cause that's what the first thing people see.
They judge you before you can open your mouth.
Heard.
I know Hecht's.
Mm.
When do you feel like,  you  no longer just had to survive, but you kind of- Not-  That you arrived.
That you were at just a good  place.
Still on that journey.
And so what do- You still work with  family services.
And do you still do HIV counseling?
Was that before- that- Was that because you were f- like,  that was the big fear?
Oh, okay.
I thought it was like, I was gonna get AIDS or something.
Cause that was a big thing, that- To keep it separate- Mm.
Mm.
And do you still live in the house- your first house that you purchased or have you since moved?
Oh.
Like,  couple months ago.
And you bought a new house?
And where is that?
Is that-  that's the- that's still in Southeast?
I don't know Southeast Gold- I've never heard that term.
Mm-hm.
Okay, now that you put it that way, I did just interview someone who grew up in that area.
So now you have- That's-  Hill- That's- You have arrived.
Mm-hm.
And you don't feel like you're at that place?
Is that more mental?
Or do you feel like that's your physical, financial, social-  or is that mental because, I still haven't reached a place I wanna be, even though I'm in a good place.
Mm.
Chaos is everywhere.
Yeah.
What do you do for fun?
Can you tell- You are the first person  that I have asked about hand dancing.
Someone told me about it before but- So what is it?
Mm-hm.
Is there anything that's iconic about hand dancing that you don't see in other dances?
Like is there a reason it's called hand dancing verse- And you touch the whole time.
Mm-hm.
What about go go music?
Inaudible Mm-hm.
Do you have a favorite song?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
W- Did they do the hat?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
She was the exposure.
Mm-hm.
Are you a Delta?
Oh, okay.
Alright, I didn't know if I had seen you wearing- Aw.
That's just cra- It's so funny, like listening  because I-  I think about my experiences.
I don't think I've had as m-  Race has been-  I grew up in the South, and race was-  it's an issue, but I think my mom sheltered me from it  a lot.
Um, and my grandma, and then when I got  you know, when I came here-  I go to- I went to Geo- It was very diverse.
But I-  coming outside and living outside of that bubble, you know, I didn't do that as a student.
So now like, hearing these stories and how much race like, played a part in like, this city from going from Chocolate City- one girl calls it the swirl that's losing the chocolate.
Mm-hm.
Do you- Have you done the- Have you been a tourist?
Or have you- Since you've always just lived here .
So do you still like-  Do you go with your grandkids to like, the monuments and- Video games and- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Without somebody calling somebody or saying something.
Mm-hm.
If you could leave a piece of advice to-  Not even just young people, but like,  anybody.
Like, especially in this time, in this space.
Kind of thinking about you being in survivor mode, what would that piece of advice be?
Do you feel like that changed the city?
Do you feel like that changed the feel of the city?
Mm.
Peop- Mm.
Out.
Mm-hm.
Yeah,  I can only imagine what it was like to watch over the last twenty years.
Yup.
That's true.
That's why everybody's on the  outskirts.
So you feel like the city's on a downward spiral?
Wow.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah, she didn't- It wasn't a lot of people that voted.
I mean it was a very small percentage of- Mm-hm.
Somebody- Yeah.
It's cause you live on the other side of the river.
It's getting to be a big hill.
It's a little mountain.
Capitol Mountain.
Mm-hm.
Just all of that going on.
Right.
Mm.
Mm.
And both parents were doing- You can barely rent an apartment for a- a- a year or two for that much.
So what do you think is gonna be-  How do you think this is gonna look in ten years?
Mm.
Nothing yet.
It's true.
And I think you can see that.
Like, I just remember coming here seventeen years ago- Yeah.
Way too frequently.
Way too frequently.
Yeah.
Oof.
Mm.
But this will always be your city.
It'll always- Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
It's not.
That's what someone else telling me about, her experience when she was really trying to get  back on her feet.
I think she had to leave home or something and  her mom  um,  wanted to move to Maryland.
She said she had to get back to DC cause they had so many more services that she could use.
And she was just across the border.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Cause that's where a lot of- I didn't.
So come in on the other side, as you come off of- Mm-hm.
Reservoir, so as you come , um,   Clara Barton Parkway?
I'm not surprised by that though.
Mm-hm.
I can't think of the intersection but I know where you're talking about.
Mm.
It's sprinkley.
It's very- It's ch-  It ain't much.
Yeah.
Mm-mm.
But didn't they just-  rebuild-  Aren't they rebuilding?
Okay, further in.
Like, deep deep in.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I was- I was up.
I was too far up.
