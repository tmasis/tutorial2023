Uh, here's a question to test your imagination.
If you had all the money you wanted,  you could get more when that ran out, what would you do?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
What if it really were a limitless supply?
In other words,  you could spend- It was so much that you could-  There'd be no point in saving because you wouldn't live long enough to spend it.
You know.
Would you do anything spectacular, with it?
