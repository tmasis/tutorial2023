Mm-hm.
And    my brother  next to me in Norfolk,  he- he-  they didn't have but two children, a boy and a girl.
The boy is in Norfolk.
He got one boy.
And the girl is in Maryland.
She got four children.
And she- her oldest daughter went to schoo- was going to school.
She out for the summer now in Boston.
And then she got twin boys.
I think they went to the tenth grade this year.
And then  she had another boy.
So all  of them is in Maryland.
And her husband.
And  the youngest one in Norfolk, now he got more children than anybody.
He had  three boys, but one of 'em passed.
Wait a minute now.
Before he married her, got- he g- he got a uh,  a son in-  in Georgia.
And then when he married  his wife RD-NAME-1,  he had a boy and a girl by  her.

And my sister RD-NAME-2, she just had one girl.
Mm-hm.
And she married now.
But she don't have any children.
