Um,  your childhood home,  Stanton Hill, tell me about it.
What's there now?
So  you were the only child.
Did you-  I know you had your big bomb pop,  did you have any other neighborhood kids that you played with or  was it mostly grown-ups that you hung around?
Which church?
What-  how was church?
Mm-hm.
So let's move a little bit from elementary school.
That was great.
Uh, That was great.
Um, so we-  N- well go-  go where you want us to go.
So let's talk about middle school and high school.
Um, because we had  a few different high schools.
Um, so let's talk about RD-SCHOOL-1 first.
Where is it?
Oh Right.
Mm-hm.

Do you still know Lavender Girl?
Mm-hm.

So there's like five  different things I wanna ask you but I know we're-  we're at the  high school part of the story, and I kind of wanna get- cause I think this is really fascinating that you went to high schools like, all over the city, which is cool.
But there's some other things I wanna ask you, so let's do the high school part, and then I wanna ask you about the artsy part  and so many just-  oh, you're just so good.
Okay.
Um, so let's talk about high school.
First of all, you started at RD-SCHOOL-2.
Why?
Why did you turn to shoplifting?
How'd you find out and why were you interested?
Mm.
Why do you-  why do you care?
Like,  because it's clearly  passion there.
I mean,  no doubt about that.
And not just because of Uncle RD-NAME-1, right?
So, talk about being a performer.
Or- or  art.
Because even you were just, what?
Crocheting?
Um, like,  that's just  unique to me.
I mean a lot of people crochet, but I mean  how did you get into crocheting, art  or poetry, dancing, I mean you are a Renaissance man right here.
Mm.
This is great.

What about poetry?
Mm.
What time?
No, at Mocha Hut.
Oh.
