Okay so it's not- it's- yeah, yeah, yeah, you're at the top.
Kind of close to the border, okay.
Mommy?
Oh, okay.
They liketa be neighbors.
Um, what did your dad do?
Where?
at different places?
Was it one company that he was  for the most part?
Mm.
Oh.
I love them.
I've- I've taken classes there, just did a presentation there not too long ago.
Um, and what about Mom?
Perfect.
Alright so that's all I'm gonna write, no more writing for me.
Alright so let's kind of back up And let's like- like get into so you were  Deanwood, So what do you remember- First of all do you have siblings?
Are you an only child?
I did not know that, that's why I love doing this because  I've known RD-NAME-2 for three years,  never heard her story.
I've known you for- it's been what, n- almost a year?
Yeah you kidding, ooh you hitting that mark.
Feels probably like lots of years.
Amen.
Um,  but  uh, so I love to get to know this.
Okay so you're an only child.
And you grew up-  Did you live in a house, a townhouse, an apartment?
Oh, okay.
Oh.
So you still- do you go back to- oh, obviously.
Perfect, okay so describe- describe like your neighborhood, your house and what do you remember like the kids you used to play with.
Um, tell me a little bit about that.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Did you play with them?
Mm-hm.
Okay.
So what did you do to fill your  time like,  you know?
So now,  the sixties so,  TV was- it was- Mm-hm.
It- it was just getting it's  go.
Um, do you remember like any- What used to be your favorite TV show and like when you-  you guys got your n-  color TV and like-  Do you remember that?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Yup.
And then- So where'd you go to ele- elementary school?
Were you in the neighborhood or did you go outside the neighborhood?
Mm-hm.
Okay.
So,  very much it seems Catholic school, religious type education?
Was that a-  that was- was that your choice?
Or your parent's choice and why did- do you know why they- It was just seventh and eighth grade at that point.
Sixth grade was still with the little people.
Mm-hm.
So when- now  going back to your parents for a minute, um,  were they- did they graduate from high school?
Did they have the opportunity to do that or did they stop?
Or did they- were they able to go to college?
Mm-hm.
And your  parents by the time they graduate- were they here for high school or did they move here later after like when they were grown?
Okay.
That's how she ended up here, okay.
Mm-hm.
Gotcha.
I was just gonna say how'd they meet, mm-hm.
Okay.
So um,  do you have other family in this area?
Mm-hm.
So it's just you guys here?
Now  are you s- guys still really tight?
Like your family I know you have um,  sons.
And then your parents- so you guys are still really really close?
Do you get together for like Sunday dinner,  football games, do y'all go out?
Do y'all have any family traditions that y'all still-  or that y'all are creating or trying to  keep alive?
Mm-hm.
Because you have the baby- I mean they're not really babies but- but you have the youngest.
So it's still a big deal for- for them.
Gotcha, okay.
So let's go back to high school because I think that before I jump to your family I kind of wanna talk a little bit more about-  about you.
So tell me about  what you remember.
DC high school is a big deal.
Where you go to high school, who you associate with, that kind of is a  big part of your identity.
So  going to Catholic school, was it a big school, small school, what was your favorite subject, who-  who did you hang out with?
Which are now the coolest kids.
Mm.
In a all black school.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
So going back do you real- like  do you- can you remember some moments where you felt that kind of ostracism like you felt like- Like did you know- You know cause at a point kids like learn racism like at a point when they realize, hey wait,  what?
Something's happening.
The- you know they don't come out necessarily like that but then they have that epiphany.
What-  like  tell me some things that would happen  once you kind of realized this was happening to you.
Oh it was pretty- okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Do you ever feel like it was to your advantage like you-  Because  I'm thinking about  back to the sixties and seventies and  this ch- city was-  there was a lot of- like, that was during the Civil Rights and then as we're getting- going through the Civil Rights do you ever feel like it was    hard beyond high school but then was it ever an advantage like you were able to do something because you looked a certain way?
No you never got-, okay.
Really?
Why do you say that?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Why do you think that is?
Mm-hm.
I have never heard that.
And I guess  because usually I'm thinking  if you're lighter  you're close- yeah.
And that was- it was- it was too close to home, there was too much ambiguity?
And so now this is very clear this is  too nebulous for me right here so I'm not sure what to do.
Like cause she ain't really white, but is she really black?
So do you feel like there was some of this kind of- Mm.
Right.
Hm.
And so now thinking about- I did, no this is great.
This is great because you have to think about um- We'll talk about other stuff but- but sometimes you kind of go off and that- that's what makes it exciting, everybody's different cause everybody has different experiences.
And so  thinking about the city  in nineteen sixties and seventies, especially  now we're in the seventies when you're experiencing a lot of this and we're- you know we got the  I'm Black and I'm Proud and we got  chocolate city but we still have a lot of racial tension.
How do you feel like- As a high schooler now cause you're very ware- aware,  the city you kind of explore you know you're not just at home you're  in high school now you're working,  how do you think the city around you  um-  How do you feel like your experience was influenced by this?
Like at- at work place, you could see that you were having these issues but as you were navigating through DC.
um, maybe with your friends or church or whatever you were doing,  do you feel like you had the- that same kind of,  uh, she- I'm not really sure if she's white or black let me stay away from her, do you feel like you were embraced?
Kind of- Really?
Why?
Like why- like and how like as you- not even just- let's take out  school from it but let's look at the other arenas.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
And w- were most of these women dark skin or darker skin?
But that was the whole- that was during the time of the paper bag test, that was during the time- So all of those things- so I think in- ma- ha- maybe there's a sense of envy or jealousy because you were light skin?
Do you think that may have played into it?
Or maybe they just was being bitchy and they just didn't wanna- and they didn't wanna talk to you.
Um,    Okay so you were in high- so- But you didn't feel this at school this was kind of more outside of the walls of your s- because your school's a very diverse place.
Mm-hm.
But it didn't feel catty?
Like it wasn't just  girl fights all the time, it was- it was not- Was it really cohesive?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
You were the little geek squad?
Do you- do you- did you have a best friend in high school?
Oh tell me about y'all's little group.
Mm-hm.
How'd you know her?
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Do you remember doing a lot of things with them together as a group?
Or did y'all- Just hanging out at school.
Gotcha.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Gotcha okay so it wasn't like y'all just hung out around town doing stuff?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
For breakfast?
Did your dad let you do a lot of like going out  and hanging out with your friends outside of just  like right after school like, it's a Saturday, can I go hang out with my friends?
Mm-hm.
Did you ever have one of those just  wild child moments like I'm'a just  buck the system because I'm'a just  be a kid and I'm'a do what I wanna do?
Gimme what do you feel like was your kind of rebellious- like what did you do in high school that you were like, ooh,  if my parents only knew.
I mean back then it was a big deal, now it probably don't even matter but- Mm-hm.
And they went with it.
That doesn't surprise me.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I'm not surprised.
I'm not surprised.
Bl- mm-hm.
And see- and see but that and-  and it's so funny like  c- because you're like the girls who kind of did their-  the whatever they were doing the way out stuff, and then hearing like  you know, I was riding up and down with the boys, like,  you know it's so funny how our perceptin- our perception of what's like  being the bad girl- Mm-hm.
Because now, you know, I heard of something on the radio this morning I  could've  died, like this  boy's talking about how he's gonna have sex with his girl for the first time.
I was like, w-  this is why we have-  I emailed RD-NAME-3 I said,  this is why RD-NAME-2 is so important.
Because we have stuff like this playing on the radio.
Those were the days.
And I wasn't born, but  hearing stories I- I  know that those were the days.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
And see now we don't.
So think about- I want you to kind of- let's um-  So you graduated.
And  you said goodbye to all your little friends, or maybe not.
Do you still keep in contact with them?
No?
Oh yeah you said goodbye.
So how did you-  From high school did you go straight to  uh, college?
And so what was that like when you left, right?
Because you had been- Mm-hm.
It was open as much as it was closed.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
And here's goody goody two shoes in the middle.
Okay, so- Mm.
Which one did you decide to- did you decide to go either of those routes?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Y'all got close?
Mm-hm.
And so what else did you-    Okay that was your freshman year, went crazy.
Mm-hm, that's what I was just about to ask.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
How was Daddy?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
That Mm-hm.
Otherwise you weren't gonna be there.
Mm-hm.
What do you feel like was your um-  So okay that wa- Wait, your freshman year you were Sigma Dove and then when'd you become- Mm-hm.
Okay.
Um, so  how was like your sophomore year?
Was it shaped by kind of your experience with the-  with the Sigmas or was it- was it still different?
Were you s-  finding something else?
Like other activities or was that your pretty much your main- Right.
And so then you became  a Zeta.
Were- how- were your parents excited about that or did they not really understand it?
W- How was that kind of telling- Okay so he was in the college life, or seeing college around him.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm, so for them- That's so interesting because a lot of parent- You know,  if you're not really  into kind of the Greek system and Greek life, it's like what is all- th- it's just a social thing it's doesn't- th- not even thinking kind of of this big picture.
So you were selling it, mm-hm.
Okay so then after you- that was your junior year, so how did that shape- That was fall,  so spring and then your full senior year, how did that shape your experiences and then kind of overall looking at college like- Could be done?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
And what-  So then- Okay.
So that was your senior year- that was your junior year going into your senior year then you graduated.
And then what happened next?
Okay.
Mm.
Okay.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
That's a lot of calls home to Daddy that uh- Mm-hm.
Was he as calm this time?
Okay.
Just wreck 'em.
Hm.
Right.
field.
So that's what you had been working for these four years or these four and a half years since you've been in school.
Do you think he was really calm because you were the first one to go to college and it wasn't- there was-  he didn't wanna push you out like- like  say forget it but he wanted you to finish it?
And you think that's why he kind of was like, let me back up?
And back off a little bit?
Yeah.
Um, so when you finished kind of what- Mm-hm.
Wow.
Mm-hm.
And they swiped the little- Imprint, mm-hm.
Was it- did you wanna work cause you wanted to like  get money, save up money?
Or did you just want to work cause you just loved like being on your own?
Mm.
Okay so how do we- how do we-  how do we end up back here like kind of what was the path of fifteen jobs to coming back?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
So how long were you married, a year?
A year and a half?
Two years?
Okay.
But you have a daughter,  and that's a great thing.
So now you came back home, were you at home with mom and dad?
How was that?
Right.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
And you were like, I'm done.
And so- Mm-hm.
And- And then how did that-  and then what did you do for  the next span?
Because how- then you  worked for a w- long time.
Um,  and then you got remarried.
Okay.
And no one got ma- Okay.
Mm-hm.
And then you're like, alright.
So  um,  and then what did you do?
Now how did you get from-  So you were working at the bank and then what was the jo- you were just working at-  whatever  payed the bills after your daughter was born?
Or are you working in your field?
Mm-hm.
Right.
Mm.
So how did you get-  because now you do- I mean it's still  administration  um, but it's a little different but I also know you do event planning, like how did you kind of- All that kind of came together.
Mm-hm.
Internet.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Billing.
Hm.
Mm.
And that was a big deal at that- cause computers were the thing at that point like you know they weren't just kind of whatever.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
It's hard to have like little hamburger when you have this- Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
I'm so sorry you gotta struggle RD-NAME-2 so sorry.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh okay yeah it's tiny.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Okay well let me- Somebody's calling us, hold on.
We'll tell 'em that you're not available.
Boys and Girls Club, this is Minnie how may I help you?
Um,  just one m- do you know RD-NAME-2 extension?
Okay, I  um- Yes ma'am just one moment.
I don't know how to transfer.
Uh-huh.
See?
That's why you the-  you the little person cause I don't know how to do that.
Alright um- So  before we come to how you- here- It's interesting that you talk about travel because like I said one of the things is looking at like culture and life in DC.
And I think when you go away,  you're able to kind of realize  what's unique,  what do you love about the city, what do you hate about the city.
So tell me how do you view DC?
Do you view it as, I love this city I wanna stay here forever and ever,  I wish this would change, or  you know, this is great this is not so great,  what are your  feelings, opinions,  what gets your goat about this city?
Mm.
Okay.
?
that's- Mm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Even as a young child?
But that's vivid.
Mm-hm.
And how do you feel like-  thinking about- So this is- now we're  thirty years later,  thirty five years later,  and l- looking-  Oh well you were four.
Yeah okay.
My bad.
My math was off.
I'm sorry.
Uh, okay.
So forty f- seven-ish years later.
Um,  you know  it used to be chocolate city.
Now we see a very-  Kind of how do you see the city  physically changing demographically changing?
How do you feel like that's affecting the city especially like, the same- your childhood home,  how many people can say  their family still owns their childhood homes?
I'm one of those.
Mm.
Be like, no that's not- Mm-mm.
Mm-hm.
Wow.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
And that's why when you said your dad-  that  you know  you guys still have your family home shocked me, I mean I love that.
But it's- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh okay.
Mm.
And that's just amazing to me like- and  you don't hear- I mean like that's a really- that's a very unique  kind of story because you do hear  you know, I had to sell my house, or I had to move away, for whatever reason but  gentrification is a real thing like it- it's- it's- it's knocking on people's doors literally and figuratively like  now.
As we speak.
And so to hear that- and I know you know  um,  as more and more time it's gonna come  farther and farther across the river you know it was slow to-  to really branch and come  cross that water but now it's- it's here.
Mm-hm.
In the city.
Yeah.
Wow.
So  how do you f- do- have you done-  have you been a tourist in your city?
You know a lot of people come from all over the world to do the monuments and the museums and- and you're down the street, do you- have you done those things?
Why?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Beautiful.
It's my favorite one.
I can sit at night and sit in there for hours.
Yup.
All the time.
Mm-hm.
Yeah no it's really bad.
Yeah.
My favorite time to go is like a random just afternoon like during the school- not during the summer but during like  the school year when kids are- like in August or September.
Like no school trip is in September so  it's not gonna be a thousand kids running around.
You can do everything.
Oh mm-mm.
So one thing you said before we started the interview,  is about  you knew RD-NAME-1 wasn't here and- and we were talk- you said the mannerisms.
What about DC and DC people is unique?
Like  that you feel-    what do you mean by that?
You can't put your finger on it.
So let me ask you about two things that are   DC things.
Go go music?
So you didn't really get into the go go scene?
When it blew up.
Mm-hm.
So  do you still- But even now that- I mean go go still it- it's most definitely when you talk about DC that's- either you love it or you hate it.
Like it's a DC thing, either you love it or you hate it.
Um, and  do you still appreciate it like even the stuff that- the later stuff?
Um, do you listen to it  often?
Not so often?
You kind of just right- just   take it or leave it?
Mm mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right?
At that moment like, no.
No no.
We don't have this.
This little  yeah.
All I can think about is like the colorful lights just flashing  like just crazy.
That's what I think about when I think about house music whereas go go I think  percussion.
I think a lot of like congos I think um, the cowbe- I think a lot of that is what reminds me of go go.
Um, and then the other one, mumbo sauce.
Mm-hm.
Is there one type of place you get it or you can get it anywhere now you feel like it's just- well it used to be a specialt- it used to be something, now it's just, it is what it is?
Mm.
But you only eat it on wings?
Mm-hm.
No most people only eat it on wings I don't see a lot of people doing a whole lot with mumbo- maybe french fries.
I think that's the craziest thing I've seen is the french frie- I- I don't- you don't do in on like  you know vegetables and all that you just- your f-  wings primary and then maybe- maybe french fries if you feeling adventurous.
That's- that's  about all you could do.
