So, um,  you were born and raised i- Well first, let me ask,  do you consent to- Okay, cool.
Oh, yeah.
Easy.
Easy, girl.
Okay,  um, so you were born in Rochester, New York, right?
And  what part of the city did you grow up in?
Oh, okay.
And  do you remember that transition?
Oh wow.
What was that  like?
Just- Right.
Right.
Okay, and I did not know  that you went to RD-SCHOOL-4.
Oh, nice.
Mm-hm.
Mm, okay, cool.
Who woulda known?
Um,  so, can you tell me more about your neighborhood?
The one that you moved to, you said it was- Okay.
Now, is your mom still over there, or?
Okay.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Right, and so a lot of the families, just to  take it back a sec to this,  uh, in this old neighborhood, they probably aren't working at  Kodak or Xerox, right?
Okay.
Really?
Okay, so most of the black people then have moved out of the state at that point.
Okay.
Okay, I was gonna say, have they moved back to the city?
But, never mind.
So I was gonna say too that it's great that they could retire because- Yeah.
Yeah, cause that downfall of Kodak really .
Mm.
Right.
Right, okay.
And so did you s-  pretty much stay out there from the time- to the time you were a senior in high school or how long were you- Yes, no, I- I hear that.
It's nice to be around family when you have kids.
Um,  so  what high schools did you go to then?
Okay.
Oh okay, cool.
So, that I'm guessing- was RD-SCHOOL-3 different from the Catholic school in terms of demographics, or?
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Okay, cool.
And what was high school like?
Was it- Yes.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Cool.
Oh, what?
Mm-hm.
Yeah, and so  I'm guessing, even though you were going out to school, to like this suburban sort of school, did you feel like you participated in a lot of activities in the city, or have friends in the city?
All that jazz.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, so, right, it- it's interesting cause it's like, you deal with that stuff  from black people, but then you have to deal with sort of like  these racialization in that sort of way from the white kids at school.
Mm-hm.
Right.
, yeah.
Mm.
Wow.
That's really good.
That's really good to be in sort of-  or feel like you're in an environment that's like safe I guess, in some sense, yeah.
Are you still friends with any,  um, one from high school, I guess, or?
Mm.
Yeah.
Okay.
So it came time to gr-  for graduation and you pick RD-SCHOOL-2 for the next phase.
What did you- No?
Oh, tell me the story, girl.
Wait, no.
I don't believe this.
I'm sorry.
My face is just shocked.
I am shocked.
Okay.
Okay.
And  how was RD-SCHOOL-3 for that one- Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
And  did you associate with anybody there, or was it just like come  to school,  Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Did you like RD-SCHOOL-2?
I was gonna say what- what was she doing?
Oh that's great.
So what about her annoyed you I guess, the most?
Was she making too much noise in the morning, or?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm the same.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I was gonna say, how were the professors?
Hm.
Yeah.
D- uh, so    I guess, what are your like favorite, if you can pick like some of your  top moments from college, or favorite things, experiences?
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
No, I had the same experience when I went to U of R.
I- I mean, nobody told me to fill out EOP, so I just didn't.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so like, you know, when I first came, all the black kids who were in EOP were like really clicky.
Mm-hm.
And what if you still need help with tutoring and like need, yeah.
And you don't get those resources if you're not in it so, uh, yeah.
I can totally relate.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right.
Right, but EOP, that whole experience is weird, and then, being expected to be in it.
Yeah.
And with minimal  debt, right.
Yeah, I- my friend- U of R was too expensive to walk away with none.
I don't know- not one person who ain't got nothing  You know, but, I do know this one girl  who was in it.
She only had like three thousand.
Somebody else I know had like maybe fifteen hundred.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
So did I.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, and so when you went in with, uh, the major English, did you expect to be- like, you know, write stories or be a journalist?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um, what was your first job out  of college?
Really?
Cool.
So what were you doing there?
Oh okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right.
So that one wasn't your favorite.
I understand that.
Yeah.
So now you're trying to go back to school for nursing.
Where are you gonna be going?
Okay.
Yeah.
That makes sense.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a tough job.
I commend teachers, especially in the city school district.
Mm-hm.
Right.
And so what made you decide on nursing  after- Right.
That sounds pretty good though.
I mean- Okay.
Mkay.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's really good, pay it off in three years.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
But they were flexible about- Wow.
Right.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
No, I can completely relate.
Well, at least you'll know for RD-NAME-2.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So do you like the school that, uh, RD-NAME-2's at right now?
I was gonna ask, like, are you thinking of keeping her through til- Mm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Right.
Yeah.
No.
I can't.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Right.
So do you think you'll move her then to- Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it's kind of- yeah.
I don't like that either by the sounds of it.
No, I agree.
I told her I didn't want her at any of those schools because it's like, they're gonna know she's different and she's not coming from the same econom- socioeconomic class.
You know and I'm afraid of what that will  do to RD-NAME-2 cause she's so sensitive.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I know.
I'm so happy it worked out the way it did.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah,  I've never heard about that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I- I'm not a big fan of combining, um, for those reasons.
Yeah that makes sense.
Yeah.
It- it really is,  and it's gotta be overwhelming for the kids to like try to navigate.
Mm.
Right.
Right.
Right.
I'm done.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I guess that's the way to go now- and here, cause it looks like people are going or people are out there for it, I feel like at, you know, the city school.
But, um, I wanted to ask you a few questions about Rochester more generally, get your opinions.
Um,  what are your, I guess, favorite aspects about Rochester as a city?
I probably don't know about that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's- yeah well RD-NAME-1 is too.
I think would do the same thing.
Um,  but,  okay, so when you say metropolitan, what pieces do you feel like, I guess are more metropolitan, and what's like that homey-  what gives you that sense of like a small town  homey feel?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I hear you.
Okay, so,  um,  w- I asked you about things that are like, you know, your favorite.
What about things you dislike, or would like to see improved in the city?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
And would you say that this is a diverse city?
Yeah, I don't really- Mm.
Mm.
Okay.
And, um, do you-  are you also thinking about that with relation to like this  city versus suburb kind of-  yeah, okay.
Mm-hm.
Oh man.
So do you-  what do you feel about I guess, uh,  the police force here?
I feel like  tensions have been rising especially this summer with like the protests and- Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
W- Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's good.
Um,  so I wanted to also turn  to some more language related questions.
Um, as you may or may not know, I study dialects across Rochester,  and so  one of the things I'm interested in that I ask people who live here is whether or not they, um, think that Rochesterians  talk a certain way.
Right, so when you go out of town and somebody hears you talk, what's maybe like the first thing they'll say?
Wow.
That's really interesting.
I've heard the southern thing.
I haven't heard the Syracuse thing, but for the southern thing,  I'm wondering how much the fact that, you know, so many people  have moved here from the South, like our parents and stuff are not native, um, or grandparents I should say,  um,  how much that affects  the perception of you know, people's speech.
Are- is your mother originally from Rochester?
Wow.
Mm.
Wow.
How?
Yeah,   Oh, the Viagra.
Yeah.
Right.
Wow.
And do you go visit them, or?
Right.
I feel like that's a thing though.
woulda been like, you getting dark, you know.
Right.
Really?
Ugh.
And I've heard that, and I- I- I guess I don't know what features or what exactly- I'm like, is it certain words?
You know is it, um,  certain, you know, pronunciations of things?
Yeah.
That's one of the things I'm really curious to  uncover, sort of like, what is this?
Yeah.
Yeah they- yeah I've gotten that espes- when I've gone out of town, definitely people from the city  and definitely, um,  folks like just in conferences, I feel like, when we would go and like  Pennsylvania and stuff like that, Pittsburgh.
Yeah and they'd be like, we thought y'all was from the South.
I'm like,  you know what I mean.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah I need to try someone doing impersonations again.
Yeah.
Everybody thinks they talk .
You know what I mean, even folks in the South, folks in the West.
Yup.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
It really is.
Yeah, it's fascinating.
Okay, well,   those are all my questions, um, so thank you for doing this interview.
Do you still consent to me using it?
I'm trying out here, you know.
Yeah, thank you.
I really appreciate it, yeah.
Yay.
Well-
