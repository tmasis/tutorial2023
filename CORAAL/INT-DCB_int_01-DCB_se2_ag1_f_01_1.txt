And he's like, uh, we need to change the RD-NAME-1 on this and put RD-NAME-1.
Yeah, he- he was like, naw, we need to change this- we need to change this.
Um, have you felt- have you ever thought about changing your name?
Oh, so you're really close to them.

Okay.
So they're still- No, no, no.
But they're still- where do they live?

Um- No, but I mean now I'm'a- When I drive down, I'm'a look for it and be like, oh, now I know somebody who live there.

That'd be weird to stalk her.
Um,  so who- okay.
So that was your parents.
Now, tell me- I mean that was your grandparents.
So tell me kind of like, your childhood home or what you remember- I know you said you hopped around a lot, so tell me a little bit about the houses, the neigh- the apartments, houses that you remember.

Great.
And when's the baby due?
Oh, she's new pregnant.
Yeah, oh- like, just- just got pregnant-ish.

Mm-hm.
Tell her don't be jumping.
The baby needs- tell her don't be doing that- Oh, oh.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Cause you get to- Mm-hm.
T- Right.
And you'd- are you- so, going back real quick.
So you have-  your mom had lots of  cousins and played and- so, it was just you.
How old is your sis- y'all are what?
Four years apart?
Five year- and then, your younger sister how-?
Mm.
That's what- Oh, wow.
So- so when you played, who did you play with?
Y'all were- Y'all were close enough that- Mm.
So, mkay.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Right.
So there- were there kids in like the different neighborhoods that you grew up?
And did you play with them?
So, what was some of the things you did as a l-  like I can only imagine like little RD-NAME-3 running around,  doing a lot.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Cause y'all- both of you together.
What school did you go to?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
So let's go back.
Why- why did you have a bad middle, uh, elementary school- Mm.
Mm-hm.
So how did you-  so you used kind of your  talking- but that was before you really got into poetry right?
That was just simply you just wanted to talk and be the star.
Like, cause if they gonna think I'm- they gonna pick at me for this, I'm- at least I'm'a gonna be smart.
I did the same thing.
That's the way I'm gonna do it- that's what- And so when you did that, like, what was- do you remember your first speaking engagement?
Oh.
That is what you do.
You do.
You talk, and you talk, but you have- but you have  great words, and I think that that's-  Like, you ain't just talking to talk.
Like, you saying something, and that's important cause a lot of- Trust me.
They talking, and they ain't saying nothing.
Um,  so okay.
So you were in middle school.
You went to- I mean you went to all these different ele- you went to three different elementary schools.
Which one was the best?
I- I know they were all- RD-SCHOOL-3.
So did y'all live in Northeast at that time?
Where'd y'all live?
Oh, mm-hm.
But- Did y'all live in RD-SCHOOL-3?
Oh y'all lived in the- oh.
Mm.
Gotcha.
Okay, so now let's go up to middle school cause we done with- you  were talking in the f- kindergarten.
Southeast.
That's when you moved to Southeast.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Oh, okay.
Congratulations.
Why?
And you were like twelve?
I can just imagine you walking- look, you know, I think you're a horrible human being.
Thank you.
Wow, you know, that's bold.
But that's you.
Mm.
I- I need to interview your mom too.
I need to interview your mom too- cause I bet she has some stories.
Mm-hm.
I can only imagine.
Just even over the last three or four months, like, sitting by her at these little things, and she'll say something, I can only imagine.
Mm-hm.
Um, okay.
So you beat up the girl.
Y'all slap- you got suspended.
For how long?
Mm, s-  Issues.
Yeah.
Gotcha.
Wow.
Wow.
And she's fifteen wearing it to the- Wa- wh- no.
Thirteen, fourteen.
Yeah.
Mm.
Comfortable in my own skin.
So today!
Mm.
What do you think was-  if you-  I want you to just kind of think back, before we get to high school, think back as a child  and in middle school,  what do you feel like  helped you learn  to really be comfortable with who you are?
What- was there a specific incident or was it just kind of over time?
They are.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
You.
Mm-hm.
Yup.
I think- so I wanna go back cause I know we've skipped- Before we go to high school, cause I know high school was a-  you did some transitioning.
Um,  but go back to- you were-  are-  you were twelve, um, and looking for a place to comete your- uh, complete your community service requirement.
But go back to um,  Boys and Girls Club cause you talk about  you got to- you go on sleep overs sort of and um, Girls Only Club.
So tell me how did you come to the- like, I know the story, but um, I don't know the whole story actually.
So tell me how did you actually end up at nineteen oh one?
Was that for every- Seventh grade?
And everybody in the school had to do that?
Mm.
What do you think- so,  what kept you here though?
Like,  it- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And so,  what do you remember- like, what's your earliest-  I mean it wasn't that long ago, but like- cause the Club has changed in four or five years, but- What was it like?
Mm-hm.
Where'd y'all go?
Mm.
And so that- that just got you hooked.
So it no longer became- at what point did it no longer become community service, but it became-  it really became, I'm just coming for me.
Like, it's- I- I mean, yeah, I'm still giving back, but it's really-  I'm here because I wanna be here, not because I gotta get my  hours logged in.
Oh.
Just cause you asked me.
That's exactly why I'm coming.
Is there anybody here that was here when you first started?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
How'd y'all get close?
And now, is she-  wait.
No she's not a gradu- she didn't grad- did she graduate this year?
Okay.
Y'all had like fifty thousand people graduate.
That's right, Y O T Y.
Are you president or are you outgoing president or incoming president?
So why are you not going to Dallas?
I thought RD-NAME-2 was going.
But how- that's what I'm saying.
How does she- Okay.
Okay.
Really wanted it.
Okay.
Right.
That was good.
But she's not an office- is she like a vice president or something?
Okay.
Mm-hm.
How long have you been president?
Just this one year?
Is it like one year or two year?
Okay!
Oh, re-elected.
Look at you.
Excellent.
So, tell me about  um, so one of the people at the Club who is very influential in your life is Mr.
RD-NAME-2.
So tell me about that ex- cause I haven't heard the full story about like, how you- I mean I know a little bit about it, but I really don't know how like, you had to like, help him get hired and all that.
I don't know him.
And I kn- I know a lot of the- okay.
Mkay.
Well Mr.
RD-NAME-1.
How many people- how many other people y'all had to interview?
Oh, cause,  okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
That was it?
You were done.
You were the water works, everything.
You were just like, let me- I gotta go to the bathroom.
I need a minute.
And so do you think he's like a big brother to you?
Like a uncle, cous- like- And most defi-  like, I look at you guys, and I look at the trust that your mom has in him, but I also look at you.
The way you trust him.
Like, even when you don't wanna do something, Mr.
RD-NAME-2 say something to you and you'll be like,  Okay.
Even if you don't wanna do it.
Mm-hm.
How did you-  how did you- okay, so this was when you  were ending up middle school actually.
So Mr.
RD-NAME-2 around your eighth grade year, right?
So talk about your time from-  so in eighth grade you were still in DC,  and then high school you started at W- RD-SCHOOL-4, so tell me- tell me about that experience, but then tell me how did y'all end up in Maryland and kind of where you are now?
And this is right here?
Um, when you were in Parkland.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Oh.
They don't know- okay.
Go ahead.
But you were still living in DC when you started there, right?
Okay.
Okay.
So tell me about it cause I- I know a little bit about it, and I know we talked kind of how it's set up, but tell me a little more about it.
Where was it?
Oh, okay.
So between Georgetown and George Washington?
Right in that area?
Okay.
Mm.
Was it something that like, set you off that- did you- made you- or you just was like, look, I just don't wanna do it.
Mm.
Just cause you just didn't care?
So,  what- okay.
So let's think about ninth grade, tenth grade before we move to Forestville.
What do you feel like was your favorite subject or what was your favorite class or your favorite experience at that school?
Like, what do you vividly remember that says, dang, I love  that.
It made you realize something that you didn't even know.
I wouldn't doubt that.
I wouldn't doubt that.
Mm.
So it was more so everything you did outside of the classroom.
Alright, so I'm'a come back to poetry, cause I know that's a big a part of your- so we gonna come back to that in a minute.
We gonna come back.
But tell me- okay, so  then, tenth grade year, you like,  I gotta- your mom's like, no, we gotta go.
So how'd y'all end up where we all are now?
Okay.
That was it.
Yup.
Did- mm.
So, okay.
So tell me about- so your current house, who lives- uh, is it just you and your bro- no, it's you, your brother, and your sister?
Oh, and your older sister too?
Okay.
Okay, so it's all six of y'all?
How many bedrooms?
Oh.
I talked to a lady- she had- it was seventeen of them- and s- she had fifteen sibl- and they had- it was- the parents had a room, and they all like, well,  you know.
It was probably like, ten at a time.
They all just slept on the floor.
So at least you got like, half a room.
You ain't on the floor in the living room.
Okay?
So it's- it could be worse.
Right.
It could be worse.
It could be worse.
Um, okay.
So you've never had your own room.
Mm.
Mm.
But you'll be gone, so it doesn't e-  And you'll be able to drive here.
So you just- okay, tell- tell- you just got your license.
And that's a long way.
That's like- I mean, but in DC like, everything is fifteen minutes.
Already?
They- mm-hm.
So do you have to have a DC-  So who  you?
Mr.
RD-NAME-2.
Oh.
Oh, cause they still live in- You- RD-NAME-2's parents.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Okay- amen.
Okay.
So you- oh, Lord.
Let me watch out.
Oh God.
And so when do you get your full lic- it's a year right?
Let me watch out.
It's only six months?
Oh God.
We had a full year.
Do you g- get to take- if you take classes do you get stuff off your drivers- like, is your insurance cheaper?
Like we- if we took a drivers ed at our school,  your insurance would be cheaper.
So one of my classes I took- it was a A- it was a easy A, and  my mom was like, yes, and we got insurance, all that.
Yup.
Wow.
Is expensive.
It i- but it's better for girls.
It's more expensive for boys.
Mm-hm.
So- Yes, because I think they say because boys have more accidents, but generally like, if we think about chivalry, right?
Chivalry is not dead.
But guys usually are the ones who drive on dates and all this and-  but they're also usually the ones who gonna get in trouble with the racing and doing all these like, reckless things, so their insurance rates are a lot higher.
But, we don't have to worry about that, so.
But you tryna get on your grandparent- okay.
Well, be safe.
And you want a car?
Do you have a particular car you want?
And your momma works for Toyota so I'm not sure if that's gonna happen.
Oh, okay.
You know I roll with a Kia.
Okay.
You know- I used to drive a pickup truck, and it's-  in DC, it is hell.
Parallel parking?
The worst.
The narrow streets?
The worst.
That's pretty much all you do?
So- Let me ask you this because people say um, that-  if you're in DC, do you consider people like, in the DMV part of DC or- No?
You- You not from DC.
What's the full DC experience?
What do you think some other things that are unique to DC?
What's- Well tell me about the carry out cause somebody else said this the other day, and I was t- What do you say when you get your carry out?
What's carry out for you?
Me, I-  Me.
Right!
What is it?
It's like hot sauce and ketchup-ish, sort of, but it's not.
It's sweet.
Where you get- Where is the best Mumbo sauce?
Where do you go?
Everywhere.
Any carry out.
You-  So you don't- When you get your Mumbo sauce, you don't go to like, a black restaurant you have to go like a Chinese carry out place.
That's where you get Mumbo sauce cause if I go like a little black place and be like, this ain't real.
Ah.
And it's- Ah.
Okay.
Alright, I'm'a have to- I never-  When I was at Clubhouse Two, you know, in New York?
The one um,  right by three ninety five, where you get on the highway,  and some kids- Every day w- some kids would come in, and I was like, what are you eating?
Like, I thought it was like, sweet and sour sauce, or like, you know, barbecue sauce that just looked weird?
They're like, nah, that's Mumbo sauce.
I'm'a put it on my fries, and I was like, oh.
Okay.
I don't know what you're talking about.
So try it on my fries first?
Cause I've never had it.
Okay.
Mkay.
Alright.
I'm'a- I'm'a report back.
Let you know.
Alright, so then you moved to Fort- How was your situation- So you didn't have this RD-SCHOOL-4 experience.
You went to- So you've been at RD-SCHOOL-3 since you moved there?
RD-SCHOOL-6.
How was that transition?
Oh, okay.
Mm.
Mm.
So have you done your ACTs or SATs?
Oh, okay.
Mkay.
Mm.
Make sense.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
The strategies and the tips now.
And so when you taking it again?
You taking it again?
Okay.
And then that's the- But that's the score you can report to Temple.
Okay.
Mm.
Right.
No, get into the school.
It's only really one school- Exactly.
It's only one school that you really trying to like- So, do you have a back up?
Oh!
I love that- I love that campus.
No, we- we won't pass number two.
Let's-we good.
One or two, one or two.
Some- You're gonna be fine.
You gonna be fine.
Because it's not just about the grades.
You know what I mean?
It'd be different if you were going into like, not even just Harvard.
Cause Harvard doesn't just look at grades.
They look at the whole thing.
You could go to Yale.
But no, Temple is- Temple is a good school, but they- You do have a well rounded- you know what I mean- like, experience.
The community service,  you- the arts, like, with the poetry and the photography, which we gonna talk about.
Don't think I forgot, and um, so like, I think that is- it's not- they not just gonna look at, oh,  well you have a three point oh.
First of all, a three point oh is a good GPA.
So  they not gonna say, oh well, it's not good enough.
Goodbye.
Mm-hm.
That's right.
She can go back.
Yup.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
So, talk about um-  Because I think- Well two things.
One, I'm- This is not even a question.
This is like- The Boys and Girls Club, I do think  is really for people, especially in your situation where nobody in their co- family has gone to like, a four year university  or had that exper- Cause there's a lot that goes into that.
So I think that this has like- d2D and stuff like that, Keystone and being able to s- do all these- Youth of the Year even helped you kind of realize, you know- This is what college is- This- I need to do these things to get prepared, um, and so I'm glad you had the opportunity.
Mm-hm.
What do you- What do you mean it's- you're at fault?
Why are you feel like you're at fault?
But that's not your fault.
That's- Mommy made that decision.
But you did go get your hair done, so.
It's kind of your fault cause that one day.
No, I'm just kidding.
Right Right.
Do you feel like your family's financial status will help you get some financial aid though?
Do Y- Oh.
Because now you have a two-  you have two income household.
Even though there are four kids?
No?
You're over the- Mm.
Yeah.
That's what I was think- I was- I was, like, hm, maybe, but-  Cause I was thinking the four kids, but I  didn't even put two and two together that y'all have a  two house- two income household.
So,  mm.
And then you're going out of state.
But you-  you know- Hey.
I'm not mad cause there's no- Yeah.
You can be wherever you are.
Hm.
Hey Grandpa!
Thanks.
Sign this for me.
Um, so,  how did you- Okay.
Let's go back, cause one of the things that I absolutely  adore about you- I admire about you, is that  you're a poet.
You- Because I study  words.
I study- So,  it fascinates me-  fascinates me.
So talk about how you got into poetry,  and kind of where you-  give me the like,  RD-NAME-3's poetry life.
After you emceed the kindergarten program.
Right.
I know- Whoo.
So five years, four year- six years.
Where we at?
Five years?
Four years?
Okay.
We'll go with that.
Mm-hm.
We'll go with that.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
And so, how did you get into poetry club- Because  you just wanted to write.
So-  So you-  Perform.
In the poetry club, you all perform.
Y'all have like, shows or- What's- what's one of your favorite pieces that you've written?
Mm-mm.
Just-  the- d- whatever has ever come in from your mind to your- your book or your phone or  wherever you write it.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
That's the one you did  at Youth of the Year.
Mm-hm.
Do you know a few lines of it?
Say it for me.
Just- even- You don't have to do the whole thing, but.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yes I remember it, and then you also did that one for um- Or you did a piece of that one for when we did- went out to um,  the Country Club, I remember.
And you use a lot of metaphors with eyes.
Why?
They are.
They are.
Um,  I'm- I love  the picture you sent with the eyes?
I love,  love that picture.
Lo- Like,  I- I- I do feel like it's very telling, right?
There's so much when you look into a person's eyes that you- Eyes.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
I could, like when you were talking about Mr.
RD-NAME-2.
Like,  you know your words were saying one thing,  but your eyes were telling a very- I mean they were telling the same story but in a very different kind of- a deeper way.
Um,  can you-  I- I just love  this poem.
The um,  brother.
Can you just tell- Like, do the first part of that?
I love it.
I-  Did you write that for um,  when y'all went for Our Lives Matter, or had you already written- You- No you wrote that before cause I saw it.
That's the one that you t- um, Mr.
RD-NAME-2 sent me the link.
But then I remember w- at the thing- It was so perfect.
Cause that was right after um- Was that right after Ferguson?
Or it was before that.
It wasn't Trayvon Martin though.
It wasn't that long ago.
Oh in between that.
Okay.
That's crazy.
Right.
That's real.
That's real.
