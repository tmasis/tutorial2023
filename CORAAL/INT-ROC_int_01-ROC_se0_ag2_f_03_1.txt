Okay.
So, do you give consent to use this interview?
All right, yep, great,  always have to start off there first.
So what part of Rochester did you grow up in?
Mm, we're gonna get to that.
We'll talk about that down the road for sure.
Okay.
And for someone who's not from Rochester, how would you describe the area to them?
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Okay cool.
And did you enjoy your time growing up there?
Hm.
Ah, yeah, I live in Corn Hill.
Well, my family.
Mm-hm  Yeah.
and so, we- I think you talked about it a little bit, but how do you think the community has changed from the time in which you were growing up versus now?
Right.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah and so, just to build on that, when you say displaced, like, where do these folks go?
That's one of the questions that I have, but do you have any sense of like, maybe what areas they're- Mm-hm.
Yep.
Yeah.
My family is from- a lot of my family is from the Nineteenth Ward.
I totally, understand what you mean.
and so, in your mind, what do you im- imagine the neighborhood will look like in maybe ten to twenty years?
That's sad.
Mm-hm Yeah.
Yeah.
And so do you think that the U of R is  trying to make an effort to maybe establish more  relationships with the local community that's there?
Or- Mm-hm.

From one nerd to another.
Yeah, cool.
Um, so you'll need to come back.

But if you need it, yeah, okay, cool.
Um.
Let's see, what was my following question after that-  Oh, where do you work now?
Yeah.
Okay, cool, very cool.
Um, so, you  mentioned- I was looking on the sheet, that you haven't, um, lived outside of Rochester, but would you consider moving for another job, or do you think you'll stay put?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a perfect description.
you know they um- Hm.
Secure something that you-  Hey well maybe it might be worth the-  Do you think it would be better if you applied- I know you said you wouldn't mind being on a college campus doing some  of that kind of work for campus?
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm Yeah.
And do you feel like Rochester is a-  Mm,  comfortable community for, uh, the LGBTQ commu- community in general or?
Right.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Right.
And so, I know you were helping with the black pride events, uh, what else would you like to see happen to kind of fix the  lack of cohesion maybe across  especially black, um, gay  youth, or the black gay community Mm-hm.
Oh, right, right.
from that kind of thing Yeah.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
And then there you might be one of  right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so, out of curiosity, would like, for example, maybe the vogue,  uh, the voguing of it, be something that happens more in a black space as opposed to- yeah, right, okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Mkay.
Just trying to, you know, keep up.
Mm-hm, he's trying to do it all probably he's good.
Yeah, for sure.
Okay.
So, I'm gonna turn and ask some more like, general questions about Rochester.
Um, so, one of them is, what are some of your favorite things about Rochester?
Really?
Mm.
That's cool.
Yeah.
I have a friend who's from here, but she went to school in Buffalo and she just swears by Buffalo .
Mm-hm,  yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, cool, Um, but I know what you mean too, by like, you live here so long and you don't notice things until you have someone else, come and show you.
The last I visited, uh, with my boyfriend, he's like, oh let's check out the brewery, and I was like I've never been therein my life .
Like, ever.
Wow.
That sounds really cool.

Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I agree with that.
And, um, just back to- you said it was really conservative in-  the younger folks at your job, do you think they're like, carrying on the same conservative mentality, or are they a little more progressive?
Cause I alwa- this is something I always wonder about.
Uh, cognitive dissonance?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
I think it was, uh, if you choose silence, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.
Something like that, yeah.
Mm.
That was a lot of effort to go there too  Mm-hm.
Yeah, like a hypervisiblity?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Do you feel like you're  kind of, I don't know maybe forced to talk about these things a little more given the climate, social climate, or whatever?
No?

Yeah.
Mm-hm.

So,  have you ever been told, uh, that you sound like you have an accent?
And how have people described it?
Really?
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Right.
And so, um,  who has told you?
Like where are these people from that have told you that?
Mm-hm.
Okay.
And do you perceive, maybe, not just in Rochester, but kind of, Upstate New York in general for people to speak in a certain way that's different maybe,  from the way you would say things or- Mm, Yes.
Mm-hm.
Wow, I don't know anything about that  Hero?
No, not- New York, yeah.
