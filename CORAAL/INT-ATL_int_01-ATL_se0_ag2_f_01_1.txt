I know it tastes good too I mean, but um, what-  that's a pretty unique choice for a breakfast dish.
I kn- I know it- I mean, it's no time  like the present to have a good meal or whatever, but, um,  is there a reason  your dish is like that?
Is it a particular diet you're in?
Okay.
What kind of prompted you to  start eating I guess cleaner as a vegetarian more so?

That's nice.
That's cool.
Um,  so,  you got a real unique perspective coming from New York, living  so many years, and also coming to Atlanta,  living so  many years.
Atlanta is becoming like a melting pot of a lot of different  types of variety of people and we already know.
That was kind of New York's  claim to fame as well.
Tell me about  growing up in neighborhoods in  New York.
What type of neighborhood were you grow up- have you grown up in?
Yeah.
Mm.
Okay.
True that.
Mm-hm.
Okay,  um,    between,  I guess New York  and your experience in Atlanta,  which would you  consider safer?
Yes.
That makes sense, so  it's a lot more crowded up there  than  in Atlanta.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay, so  eh-  in your neighborhood,  let's say back in New York,  did you go to a school that was close by, or did you have to go all the c- way across town or something?
Okay.
Mm-hm.

Okay.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Definitely a clinger.
Definitely a Klingon.
Um, what you call again?
Let's see,  go a little bit deeper, cause  usually a lot of people, when they come to Atlanta for about five years, they-  they become ATLiens, and they kind of adapt the flavor and the swag, but you really- you really holding on to this NY you know dialect  and culture.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Go deeper like, what's the difference?
Like, you can tell somebody  from New York  by the way they walk or they talk.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Okay.
True,  true.
Okay,  nah, nah, nah, it's- that's fair.
But, um,  I know you're least able d- to  decipher  the- some of the lingo and the language that Atlanta people use.
What is some that you're familiar with,  that you just know Atlanta people use  all day everyday?
