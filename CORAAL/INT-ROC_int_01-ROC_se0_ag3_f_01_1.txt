Um,   so, I'll start off with asking you questions about like, um,  where you grew up, and you were born here right?
Okay, cool.
Yeah, and what part of Rochester did you grow up?
Okay.
Mm-hm.
So the west side is like your home.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, and how would you describe I guess, RD-ADDRESS-1, um, which is like a suburb, in comparison to  like, uh, the west side of Rochester?
Mm.
Oh, okay.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
So I've been hearing interesting things.
At least in the nineteenth ward there are a lot of college students now who d- weren't there before.
How do you think they're changing like the culture of the community I guess?
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Right.
And to someone who I guess is not from Rochester, how would you describe, um,  I guess the west side or like the nineteenth ward?
Mm-hm.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,  so would you describe then, uh, the community also as diverse  in terms of- Yeah.
S- hold on.
Let me see.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, well so where are all the black people going then?
Okay.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Um, you touched a little bit like on the economy.
Um,  I wanted to talk  a little bit about Rochester's economy.
So Ro- uh, Kodak was like the  employer  for everybody.
Did you ever work at- Okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, that makes sense.
So where do people work now, you s- like what characterizes  sort of the job- the kinds of jobs people get now, I guess?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
And what's interesting about that though is that  they don't have the same types of benefits  I think as like Delphi and like K- Mm-hm.
Right.
Yeah.
I know people,    yeah, degrees and stuff like you said, who are there and make, what, thirteen, twelve dollars an hour.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Um,  I wanted to ask a little bit more about  where you went to school, like elementary, middle, yeah.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Cool, and was middle school also in the same neighborhood, or- Okay.
Okay.
Um, And what was RD-SCHOOL-3 like  back then I guess?
Okay.
Right.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I didn't know that either.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's great.
So after you got your trade, what made you decide to go to school for criminal justice?
Mm-hm.
Right.
Okay.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Nah, I, uh, totally understand.
I get it.
I feel like, you know, my mom would do the same.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Makes sense.
Um,  so you talked a little bit also about, uh,  the crime here and stuff in Rochester, and I'm curious to know like, do you think,  um,  that it's changed over the past few decades, or it's something that's kind of been here for a while and just,  has it been resolved, or- Yeah.
Yeah.
And  I guess what kind of, um,  programs were-  things that- have you feel like-  have you felt like Rochester have tried to done-  do to like improve upon  the crime in the city, or- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, and I feel like it's  happening a lot with younger  and I'm- I just wonder like why are younger people,  um,  yeah, I guess, more likely to,  uh, commit the crime.
Yeah.
Sh- Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And  do you ever ke-  uh, I guess, run into or catch up with some of like,  uh, the cases on your workload?
Yeah.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Especially if your perpetrator is like right there.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Okay,  um,  I wanted to aks you some more questions I guess about  growing up in Rochester and just how you've seen the city change.
Um,   so, uh,  in particular you talked about like your neighborhood changing in terms of the demographics, right.
Black folks are moving kind of out.
Um,  are there any other changes you've noticed?
Yeah.
Um,  and  you, uh- what about the schools, I guess, do you feel like  I hear mixed  reviews about them.
Do you feel like they're getting  worse, uh, than when you guys were going to school, or- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Um, I also noticed that a lot of, uh,  I guess,  people my age or millennials are kind of moving away from Rochester altogether like your daughter went to- yeah.
Um, what do you think it would take  to get  more of us to stay around?
Why- yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,  and,  mm,  kind of-  are there any other changes that are  recognizable to you, I guess, in terms of  maybe the whole of Rochester, or- Yeah.
Okay.
Um,  let's see.
I have some other questions.
Didn't print 'em out.
Um,  so we talked about schools.
We talked about  college,  neighborhoods.
Well I think I covered all  your bases.
Um,  oh, I know what I could ask you  that would  be good,  um,  if you  remember any of the stories, I guess, from your parents about  them first coming to Rochester, and sort of what it was like and,  you know,  yeah how it's changed and- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Unless it looks- terrible.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Um,  another question that I had was about sort of, uh,  things to do here.
Like what are people into?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For sure.
I would agree with that especially thinking about like the jazz fest and- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah I went to see Erykah Badu.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It wa-  it was  a different kind of entertainer though,  for that crowd.
Some people were feeling like a- people who don't know her stuff were feeling like, uh, she's not really jazzy.
Yeah.
So I'm like, okay I can see where- Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Cool.
Yeah.
I think she puts on a good show for sure.
Yeah.
I was also thinking about what other kind of artists  they could bring down the road.
Um,   I think, uh,  Lalah Hathaway would be a good- yeah, the artist to bring.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
But I feel like, like you said, concerts are kind of the-  and festivals- yeah, are the- Wow.
Wow.
You said in Webster or on- Yeah.
Cause I- I feel like I don't know, most of the stuff I know that's like music related happens downtown or, you know.
But okay.
Cool.
Mm-hm.
Yup.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So  it sounds like then you would say like there's a  pretty healthy, like, uh,  s-  there's a healthy, what is it, entertainment, kind of scene, or- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right, cause we're not like a New York City, but still think there are- seem to be things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,    so I have a few last questions, and they're more like, uh, I guess you could say, language related.
Um, and I always ask people whether or not,  um,  Rochesterians  sound- or certain Rochesterians  sound a certain way or speak a certain way  or, for example, when you go out of town, do people tell you, you know,  oh you sound x way, or you sound like you're from here.
Yeah.
But with people who like, uh, maybe you don't know, do you feel like, oh those people  s- uh, say certain words or things like that funny or interestingly?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
And, uh, with your,  uh, parents being from the South, do you feel like you've picked up on any of the thing-  Right.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
Um,    that is all the question- that- well, those are all the questions I have, but if you have any questions,  um,  yeah.
So far, um, I'm almost at twenty.
Yeah, just about.
Y- uh,  I have some of the same questions, overarching ones that I ask just about their experiences here, but depending on what someone tells me about stories or what not, I'll ask more details about  that particular thing.
Um, so  the interviews don't always like l- yeah, they don't all look the same, which is the fun part for me.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Yeah, for sure.
It's helping me to get a  kind of, uh, uh,  different perspectives,  right, on the same place.
It's nice to hear, you know, people's opinions of,  you know, what they enjoy, what they don't enjoy, you know, what Rochester used to look like, you know, and see what people agree upon, and where they don't agree upon things.
It's just from a- I guess you could say, from like an anthropology sense, it's nice to just look in and see what people think of,  you know,  the city, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Yeah, I feel like some of the things that,  uh,  there's ju- there are just some things I don't know because of my age, right.
So like, you know, I-  I like to talk to, uh, especially older folks about what Rochester used to look like because I have no  kind of intuitions about that.
But also too, like,  I didn't really realize a lot of the things about Rochester that people have brought up to me until I was older  in my life.
So  some people will say, oh well it's kind of segregated, and  I never thought of it as such, and I'm like, uh,  okay, if you're thinking about maybe suburbs versus city, then okay.
Yeah that makes sense.
So for me it's also kind of like an uncovering process of like, oh yeah, these things do exist, but I just never really  paid attention,   um, when I was here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
And that was what, the first indoor mall I think in the United States.
I was gonna say, what are they replacing-  Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was gonna say, what kind of specific Rochesterian like memories do the younger kids have?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Yeah.
That was tradition.
I definitely remember- I could be- remember like being so excited to go downtown to like that's when you knew it was Christmas.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Same.
And I- I also have been thinking about like,  yeah, what places are there  around here that  are really historical and that kids can  remember?
Yeah.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Cause I feel like we have a, uh, lot of other rich history here regarding like, you know, Frederick Douglass.
Oh my god,  been.
Right.
George Eastman House.
That- okay.
I've done that several times.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
That sounds familiar.
Yeah.
And I guess too there are things like pumpkin patches and- yeah, plus those are still kind of more so outside of they city.
Yup.
Mm-hm.
I didn't know that.
Wow.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, no, it was same.
We-  if I'm here in town we go to the ones on Saturday.
Yeah, and they just got the Food Tr- Truck Rodeo there on Wednesdays.
Yeah.
I've been once, but, yeah.
I hear they change the trucks s- and stuff like- yeah, so.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
So I kind of- yeah, I- I think I like the-  there's still touches of a  small town or  community oriented.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Right.
No, you're absolutely right.
Yeah.
Okay, um, yeah, so  the only, uh- yeah, I always ask too if you consent to  me using this interview again at the end of the interview just to- yeah, okay.
Great.
Okay, awesome.
Thank you.
