Um,  yup.
We're recording now.
Um, ay, this is  RD-NAME-3.
I'm gonna be in-  ducting this  interview,  or conducting this interview  with  Mr.
RD-NAME-1.
Um,  RD-NAME-1,  may I have your  guess, government name?
Mm-hm.
Nice,  definitely hit on a lot of points that  I ain't even have to ask for.
So, um, let's just get right into it.
How, um,  long you been living in Atlanta?
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Wow, okay.
Now, that sounds like a very interesting story that can, um, indirectly  tie into- what you call it again?
Um, how old are you?
Ooh, okay, okay.
Yeah.
I'm a little bit older  right now, I'm twenty-seven.
Um, let's see,  what's your  nationality, or what do you identify as?
Okay.
I can dig it.
Um, Let's see, obviously  you're male.
Okay.
Um, let's see.
What about school-wise,  did- did you actually say how long you been  living in Atlanta for?
S- yeah.
Mm-hm.
Fresh out the  Wow.
Oh I caught your early wave with Atlanta.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nice, nice, nice.
Congratulations on that.
I believe it, but you persevered.
What did, um, getting your degree,  you know, teach you in particular?
What did you learn from that?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Wow.
Amazing, amazing.
Um, let's see,  so,  that's-  that's cool.
Let's- let's backtrack to  like, um, maybe middle school in, um,  Cali.
How does that compare-  I know middle school and college is a totally different experience altogether.
But what about  w-  some difference as far as the culture  in Cali .
Okay.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
It's so true though.
A lot of people say that.
Mm.
Wow.
Mm-hm.
Oh yes, we gonna get into all of that,  a good  twenty-five or so  thirty so  forty so minutes to kill right quick, you know.
Well, yeah, let's, um,   what do we want right now?
Let's go even  just  more  things that can segue into more things.
Um,  what kind of food do you enjoy?
Mm-hm.
Fancy shit.
Wow, okay.
Good to know.
Niggas like ordering ???.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
some   like   You could've brought us some steak.
Wow.
That's a strong statement.
I heard that it's a big- bigger thing in California, way bigger than Georgia.
I don't see that many Jack in the Box.
Ew.
That sounds fucking disgusting.
Oops.
I'm sorry.
My-  That's crazy.
So what does it taste like, bacon milkshake?
Mm.
Yeah, I do that sometime.
It probably is w- way better .
Yeah they got fried ice cream I guess and all sorts of different stuff like that.
Bacon ice cream.
Whatchu- just the- just the-  just the audacity for them to even put it on the board.
I gotta try it.
Ah.
Man, we can continue this talk about bacon, bruh.
Like what- what else do they sell there that was bacon related?
Mm.
I love the way that shit sound.
Bacon bacon burger.
Okay.
Ooh.
Bacon bits?
Bacon bits, oh.
Why- why do you think they took it off the menu?
Mainly  y- you was the only one supporting for that.
They could  maybe at least bring it back  like they bring back the McRib.
I would definitely try one of those.
We all the way in sync, cause I was definitely gonna bring up hooping next.
Why do you like basketball so much?
Mm-hm.
I was talking to somebody that the other day  Yeah, sometime people just- sometime people just, hey I hate you number thirty-two to a hockey player or a football player and shit.
You just like a swole nigga with some dreads.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
That's true.
Football is a lot more strategic, premeditated, y- alright here it goes, and just, this is how it planned out type stuff.
It's a lot more variables.
Every time.
Kobe Bryant was on a NBA court for twenty years.
just running, like the bottom of your soles under your foot should just be bleeding just out, like how is that a normal thing for a human being to be able to do?
Jumping   Basket- ball.
Oh, you gotta put those miles into consideration.
Those miles don't go nowhere.
Kobe's definitely  my favorite player over Jordan  at the end of the day.
I fuck with both of them, you see Jordan there, Kobe there.
I recognize him as the best, but Kobe  is just that nigga  man.
He's that mother fucking guy.
For Bryant to really show me something for me to even- it's just like  not yet, not for real Kobe's Kobe.
whose fault is that cause what if that really did fuck with LeBron to where he couldn't play?
They always talk about that.
That's the worst possible thing.
He just what?
He just didn't wanna seem like a bitch?
Why the fuck  Hey,  You could die.
But is LeBron  talentedly better than Michael Jordan though?
Is he more basket-  well now I don't know.
I don't wanna say basketball fit More athletic.
He's bigger than him.
He stronger than Jordan.
He's faster.
Mm.
For his size.
You think so?
You don't think that woulda made LeBron a better basketball player and just still smash on Jordan?
Yeah.
He wouldn't  Yeah.
Yo, Nah,  Mm.
He said he's got the game on tape.
But LeBron be passing though.
Oh, you- you think it's a problem for LeBron to be- like cause I always thought Michael Jordan was cool, but I didn't think he passed the ball enough.
Mm.
Oh, okay.
Mm.
Mm.
But it's a- but I mean it's like a good open shot usually if you pass it off.
It not like the dumb play cause maybe me-  maybe he know his game.
Okay, mayb-  so what, Jordan can shoot better?
I guess mid-range down  yeah.
He got the better jump shot, period.
LeBron- That closing thing nudges him over everything else, the fact that- LeBron triple double.
Oh, you're saying like he- I think I remember that too cause I think they was gonna lose that bitch.
He steals- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because what- are you comparing them- his, um,  career to Jordan?
Cause Jordan stayed in the Bulls?
Like who?
I f- I ride with them.
Kareem- Kareem came from Milwaukee though.
He had a championship with them too.
So what's the difference?
So it's okay for the owners to not make it fair, but it's-  you know, it's- I mean it's fair for the owners them not make it fair, but it's not fair for the players that make it- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Damn.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh.
Oh.
It's like ma- It's like matter fact I'm just going to summer jam up in the- Oh.
Because he wa- he was the man, man.
I was talking about KD just then.
A lot of people say that.
I- I gained a lot of res- even more respect for him.
I'm- I'm'a-  I'm'a thug it out with KD.
Yeah.
They had enough.
They coulda beat OKC.
They coulda beat OKC this year, definitely, w- if- but I don't think Durant woulda played as good as he did or  Westbrook woulda played as good as he did  with them together.
And that's amazing.
That really is freaking amazing.
Russell Westbrook is the MVP like it or not- Kevin Durant is the best player in the world right now though  in-  including  Russell Westbrook being the MVP.
He's still acting like that and performing like that technically.
On the best team, which sucks  for everybody else, but  that's what it's gonna go down in history as.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
That's the weirdest shit ever.
I ain't gonna lie.
Oh, then s- oh, and they- and w- we lose and they like, ay man,  we still winning though.
Come-  come- come play Yeah, and you  Nah.
But-  but think about it- but- but think about it like this.
What if you had to sit down with those people,  and it was  thirty other teams in that bitch,  and you know  that they was gonna have to play before you got a chance to play again.
That could be- sh.
That nigga mighta not ever had another chance to ever  get back to  wherever, bruh.
you see how they talk about Charles Barkley?
You see how they talk about Chris Webber?
You see how they talk about Dominique Wilkins?
AI?
T-Mac?
They be shitting on these niggas, man, heavy.
And these some of the greatest niggas.
shitting on Yeah.
Them niggas didn't even like they owners like that.
They wish they coulda did the shit that  Kevin Durant did.
It's a different type of freedom.
Yeah.
What if he wasn't really- Ooh, damn, how did he sell out?
Okay.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Ah.
Ah.
That's a great- great a- re-analogy right there.
Yeah but wasn't the  Clippers up three one la-  the year before that, and you see what happened to the Clippers now.
They're gone, but they was beating LA though.
The- LA was horrible, all time horrible, the Lakers.
Like I couldn't even root for them niggas no more like- I'm not.
Obviously I'm a live- I'm a live hard Lakers fan though.
You from LA.
you ain't know another way.
And I rock with Smush Parker.
I couldn't stand him though.
I- I mean he was super asshole.
Shoot on the game though.
Nah, they don't.
I definitely remember Maurice Evans bruh,  Von W- Ay you really l- naming 'em.
This- Ay this is a- like a nineties baby's Laker list right now.
I thought you were gonna say AJ.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Woah.
Damn.
What did- um, what did Portland do to LA?
Oh shit.
That's some- that's some big rooting.
Yeah.
And who was on that team, like Clyde the glide Drexler or some shit?
Ooh,  Scottie Pippen was turning up.
Okay, Scottie Pippen got somebody to the- to the Western Conference final.
Steve Smith.
They shoulda won that bitch.
Who did they- who did they lost against?
Who that?
Shaq and Kobe?
Yeah.
Oh the w- oh shit, the famous lob.
Kobe's famous lob.
That was art.
And they wasn't even liking each other back then.
They was definitely beefing, but that moment was just too surreal.
You had to live in it.
Oh my god.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,  do be taking it too long.
That's why I don't even wanna come out and say who I'm rooting for cause they'll- they'll take the whole rest of the night just dogging you.
Oh my goodness.
s- I believe it.
Oh, real LA fans to the core Let's see, what else?
Um, you into video games?
Okay,  Woah.
Woah.
s- I gave up on live, man.
I'm- I'm assuming they done for.
Definitely my f- I was definitely going hard for them at one point.
That is a dumb ass fan base.
It's so real.
Oh my god, I didn't even get in the story modes but they are amazing   RPGs joint.
from everybody else  they swear they go extra hard on some Call of Duty.
But I'm not expecting to win or whatever.
We- we need a video talking about the  over anxious douchebag, yeah.
Halo.
