Oh both were- Mm-hm.
We'll see how this goes, we may have to move just cause of the-  if I can pick you up, I think it's picking you up  fine though.
Okay.
So,  tell me a little bit about Congress Heights, um, your family  um,  your neighborhood.
Mm-hm.
Are you the youngest, oldest?
You're the oldest, so how old are your brothers?
And then  y-  that's  two.
Y- it's- there's three of you total.
Oh, oh, oh, oh okay I was- added  four.
I w- I don't know why I was adding it.
Okay.
And  so do you think,  especially in this neighborhood you said that  it was just a lot going on, but that was the neighborhood your parents grew up in, how do you feel like being a young black man  and seeing kind of this-  this neighborhood and this going on around you?
Why do you feel like that?
Mm-hm.
Yup.
Do you think that   your mom had it really rough?
Um, are you the first one in your family to graduate from high school?
Oh okay.
Cool.
But  out of like your-  your-  neither your mom or dad graduated from high school?
No?
Um, are you going to college?
And you wanna do IT?
A- and then  what do you wanna do specifically like  there- cause that's a big field.
I mean computers is a good job, you're always gonna have a job.
Like  that's- technology is really booming.
So,  let me ask you a couple different questions  kind of based on that.
Thinking about- have you- so you haven't really lived anywhere else outside of Congress Heights  but  you've traveled to other neighborhoods  and then you've gone to  um-  So tell me kind of what do you see that's different from  where you live versus  like some of the other  neighborhoods,  do you see a difference?
Are you allowed to go into other neighborhoods?
Okay.
What do you mean?
So do you see-  I wanna talk about your high school in a minute,  um, cause I've heard some interesting stories about RD-SCHOOL-2,  but do you see-    are turf wars like  real?
Do you see that happening?
Can you tell me a little bit about it?
And what- what happens?
Like,  you know.
So how do people come like-  and do we have kids here at this club from both neighborhoods?
Or is it mostly one neighborhood?
Is it  Parkland or Twenty second?
Mm.
And do you see that often like people are just in fear?
Wow.
And so- okay.
Wait a minute.
Let me back up.
So do you feel like it was a time personally like, RD-NAME-2 you were like, oh my God I'm gonna die,  like, something's gonna happen to me right now?
When?
Can you tell me about it?
What happened?
How did you- so how did you end- how did you start coming here?
How did you start coming to the Boys and Girls Club?
And when was that?
So you've been- okay, so you've been coming down here for that long.
And what do you feel like  has been-  so you've had lots of experiences  in those three years, what do you think has been like the most influential or like the best experience you've had?
Mm.
What do you think changed it?
So I heard you went to this program last week, tell me a little bit about it and like how did you get the opportunity?
What- how did you get into the program?
Tell me about the program.
So what happened?
How'd you- how'd you like  dress and- Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
What do you think was the most touching story that you heard at the program?
When you- oh, entrepreneur.
Mm.
Wow cause you felt like he cared about your situation and what you were doing.
Do you think that,  um-  that-  that something that you can do  can change kind of your neighborhood and can change how people look at you and how people  receive you even though you're still young?
So how d- how-  how early did you feel like you had to kind of  watch your back like how old were you when you realized like, dang I gotta like check and make sure ain't nobody gonna roll up on me?
What happened when you were twelve?
The Metro station?
And  like some guys just came and like just was like- Like they robbed you, or did they beat you up?
And it was the two of you guys and how many of them?
So, okay.
So now-  where'd you go to middle sc-  you went- where'd you go for mi- elementary, middle, and then we'll talk about high school.
You went to- Okay.
Where is that?
That sounds familiar.
I think so.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
So tell me about RD-SCHOOL-2.
How was-  like,  are there a lot of-  because  it's not just people from Southeast South, it's a lot of people from everywhere.
Mm.
Right.
Did you- what- did you see a lot of gangs and-  and stuff at the school?
So it would be segregated by neighborhoods?
Mm-hm.
What was your favorite subject in school?
Hi- why?
So what do you think- okay that's interesting that you talk about how  like DC-  um,  what did you learn about like DC culture?
That you thought was interesting.
Mm.
Do you feel  a certain pride about DC like,  this is my city?
Why not?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Why?
And that's what you deal with everyday.
So how do you stay positive?
How do you stay strong in that because that seems really  hard.
Like, it's hard to see like your friends getting killed or  drugs or whatever you see every day.
Mm.
Why do you respect him so much?
Mm-hm.
Right.
So y'all kind of share informa- or exchange information.
What do you feel like is a piece of advice you gave her like kind of  um,  to protect yourself like,  cause it's- it's real.
How did you feel when you graduated from high school?
Mm-hm.
Do you work now?
Mm-hm.
What do you wanna-  kind of what do you wanna work in now?
Like if you can get into-  you wanna try to get into IT now or you wanna try something else before you do that?
So you just wanna kind of get any kind of job just to kind of bring some money in.
Are you still staying at home?
That's good.
That's you got  you know that support system.
How did your mom feel when she saw you graduate?
Mm-hm.
And what about your little brothers?
Do you remember-  so thinking back cause it's about what, f-  six year gap between you and your youngest brother-  or your younger brother,  what did you do as a child?
Do you remember d- like, did you jump rope, hopscotch?
Well I guess that's more girl stuff.
Did you like do jacks?
Basketball.
And you just reffed the game.
And how'd you get into that?
Is that just something you do for the little kid- like how did you get into being a ref?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Do you think-  do you think you see some of these little kids and you think about yourself when you like, oh I remember  when I was- I wish I had Boys and Girls Club?
Mm.
So you said your dad was locked up for what, seven years?
So what kind of relationship do you have with your dad?
Mm.
Was it drugs?
Do you see that often in like-  do you see that as a kind of a l-  a lot in your neighborhood or even just around DC do you see drugs as like a big- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
And how long did he do that?
Hm.
And what-  what message-  if you could leave one message  to your little brothers or to some of the kids here  or even people your age, what would you say to them?
Like what would that message be?
Mm.
So let's talk a little bit about your family, I know you talked about your  brothers and your mom and your  dad,   do you have other family here?
Like,  aunts, uncles?
C- lot of cousins?
Do y'all get together regularly like do y'all watch the basketball games together or do y'all do like Sunday dinner?
Mm-hm.
What's your favorite social media site?
Why?
Mm-hm.
What do you think  um-  so you have- okay so y'all get together, y'all just talk,  where does your grandma live?
Oh okay, in the same neighborhood.
Okay.
Um,  so now you live with your dad, in-  in Congress Heights, where does your mom l- Oh your dad lives in what neighborhood?
So-  Okay wait a minute.
So is that-  That's also different right?
If you- h- s- So are you there all the time or you with your mom- how- you split time?
Mm-hm.
So how do you-  okay,  do you-  is it different when you go to your dad's neighb- like, How is that?
Like, cause you not from that area.
Do you feel like that's true?
Even when you're at home you don't even feel safe?
Wow.
And this- t- this happens- this is not anything  out of the n- ordinary like this could happen any random Tuesday?
Why do you feel like it's like- okay I know we not- I- so we gonna move off of that but that's just so interesting to me like to hear  you say this cause this is not something you just started noticing either I'm sure you did- you've noticed this all your life.
And what is- what's his neighborhood?
Okay that's- Oh that's the Northeast okay okay.
Mm-hm.
So now think about how the city- I don't know if you're-  like if you  notice or if you see how the city is changing cause you're  still fairly young, um, but this used to be Chocolate City.
And now like if you get out of ward seven and eight it's very different.
And why do you think that is the case?
Or do you see that anywhere else?
Like- Do you feel like-  you said  black people fear white teens?
Or do black teens feel- Do you feel like a lot of that's  because of what's happening in the new- with all the police and stuff?
So  let's- let's move away for that- from that for a second.
What's your favorite book?
Or your favorite TV show  and why?
Do you have a favorite show  on either of those channels?
Um,  what do you think-  where- oh,  you said about going out,  do you listen to go go music?

Um,  so no go go,  what about  mumbo sauce?
That's a very DC thing, right?
You can't get that anywhere else.
Tell me about where is your favorite place to get your mumbo sauce?
Any carry out?
So how do you order- how- what do you order when you  get your-  how do you order it?
Like if I was trying to go and order me some- And do you have a favorite carry out or just  any of 'em?
Um,  and then  let me ask you this, do you feel like  there's anything other than like, mumbo sauce and go go that make DC unique?
What?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Right.

So can you give me a little bit?
Can you-  can you tell me- cause it was what, two, three minutes long?
So if I was sitting in the audience can you give me the speech or  what you remember, it don't have to be exact word for word.
Besides basketball cause I know that's a big thing, what else do you do for fun?
Mm, how long you- have you played chess for a long time?
How'd you learn to play chess?
He just was want- he- w- took the chess board out saying, we gonna play chess?
That's really interesting, I don't think I've heard it quite like that before.
