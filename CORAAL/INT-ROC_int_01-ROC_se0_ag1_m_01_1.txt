Alright, so, yeah, before I start asking questions, um,  do you consent to the interview?
Okay cool, so like I said it's-  it seems more formal than it actually is.
I just wanna know about  what you perceive Rochester to be, what it was like to grow up here, where you went to school,  what you wanna do next, just those sorts of questions.
So they're open ended.
You can take 'em in different,  uh, directions.
There are no like, right or wrong answers, it's just, you know, your perspective about the city.
Um, so  I usually begin, um, asking  whe- in what part of Rochester did you grow up?
Really?
Ah.
Oh.

Hm.
Mkay.
Mm-hm Mm.
How do you spot 'em, what do you- Yeah.

Mm-hm Yeah,  yeah, so- but you would overall say you're more of a-  let me turn this up,  more of a city- Uh, yeah  Yeah,  right.
That's like a point beyond suburbs in our minds right?
Yeah.
Okay,  cool.
Um,   w- I wanted to talk, also, with you about y- schools you went to.
So I know you went to RD-SCHOOL-4.
Um, And  what made you decide to go to that particular high school?

Mm-hm,  that's cool.
Um,  okay, great.
So, I have a- like a couple more questions.
Um, that are more so geared toward, like,  your thoughts about Rochester.
And sort of how it's changing, the things that you like,  what you wanna see improved,  those sorts of things.

So,  you're looking to stay in Rochester though, long term?
Or are you wanting to move eventually?
Mm-hm.
Mkay.
How do you feel like we're different from like downstate?
Okay, yeah so do you think that Rochesterians have an accent?
Or certain people who live here sound like they're from  Rochester maybe, more than others?
Yeah.
Right, right.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm.
I'm glad you brought that up.
I was just gonna ask you like, what are the stereotypes about sort of this place,  people who live here, especially black people in the city?
Mm-hm.
So how do you try to move through I guess, or navigate your way through  those kinds of stereotypes right, that exist about  us, or like people who live in the city?
Like how do you see yourself in relation to that?
Mm-hm.

Um,  at the, protest you were talking about.
Yup.

More work to be done.
Well, thank you.
I'll just wrap up.
Uh, do you consent to me still using the interview,  before I turn off the recorder.
Yeah?
Okay.
Always have to ask at the beginning and the end.
Um, I really appreciate you taking the time out to talk to me.
Um,  yeah,  thanks.
