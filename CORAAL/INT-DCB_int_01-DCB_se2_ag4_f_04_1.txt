Tell me about Hain's Point.
I remember when I was in college that was one of my favorite places to hang out especially because the statue was there,  and then they moved it and that really hurt my feelings.
But I have no reco- I remember people talked about  you know, when you'd go there to hook up and hang out, and  I don't have recollection of that.
I just walked there to sit and watch the- sit at the statue.

Did you- Okay, so that's the other-  One thing you said  way back- And I wanted to go back to when we were talking about U Street  and the riots,  do you r- I know you were really young  when they happened, like,  kid kid.
So do you remember- Do you have any  reco- um,    recollection through like, your own eyes, not what your mom told you or your dad or your sister but like,  how you felt in that  time?
