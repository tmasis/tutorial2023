But there's one thing that I wanted to get back to that you-  you mentioned early on and you wanted to talk about that we haven't talked about it,  and that was the whole thing about s-  s- where'd you go to school.
Okay.
So  there are probably a lot of different reasons why people-  that people would attribute it why that's important, why that's sort of unique here.
But I can tell you  that I remember early on  there was huge rivalries  between the schools.
And  on a number of different levels.
So there was  in sports,  in academics.
Um,  all of the schools  used to have  ROTC programs.
And  every year  they would have a huge  huge  competition.
It was a really really  big  deal.
And  the schools, the- the- the guys in the program,  they had this drill competition,  they would train.
They would train as hard as  the basketball and football players would train.
It was a really really big deal.
And, um,  there was a lot of public recognition for that.
Um, growing up  here when I was in high school,  we had the Washington Post and the  Washington- the Evening Star.
Two newspapers.
The  high school  sports  dominated  the sports pages  on  Saturday and Sunday.
Not  the professional sports,  the high school sports  dominated  the sports pages  on Saturday and Sunday.
And  that was a-  high school sports was huge  here.
And so there was a lot of school spirit around the- the rivalry between  the  school teams, and there were certain schools that had  special and unique rivalries, so  there was a huge rivalry between McKinley Tech and Eastern,  between Coolidge and Roosevelt,  between,  um,  Dunbar and Cardozo,  between Roosevelt and Cardozo.
Um, later on there was a big rivalry between,  uh, Western and Cardozo.
Um,  so  people were very  connected and very loyal to  their-  their- their high schools and- and that- and that's how you-  you- you knew people and so when  you  talk about where'd you go to school,  that also told you something about where they lived and where they grew up.
And  everybody knew somebody at one of the other schools, so  that was the way  that you made connections, so  if you say,  um,  I asked you the question where did you go to school?
You say you went to Coolidge, then the next question is, so when did you come out of Coolidge?
And then you tell me when you came out,  so then the- the next response is well you must have been there when  so and so and so and so was there.
Did you know  so and so who lived  over here,  over there,  that sort of thing.
So  it is-  that's how people connect  with- or used to anyway-  connect with one another.
So now we have a bond  because  I know  so and so who went to school with you, and you know them-  you know them too.
And then  you ask about somebody else,  and then there's somebody that you know that went to school with me,  and so now we're talking about  all the people that we know and the ways in which we were connected  to- to one another through the people we know.
