Mm.
Mm.
I could remember  my first home  back in  probably nineteen sixty.
Three years old, and I can remember  my brother was born in sixty-one.
That's why I can remember.
Nineteen Sixty.
Cause I can remember my mama was pregnant.
And we lived on Dampier Street, which is uh, off of highway thirty-one.
That's.
Near- going to the old airp- going to- toward airport.
Mm-hm.
There was probably like  the traditional  three m-  what they called shotgun houses back then.
About three rooms.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
My brother,  and my dad.
I  had  t- two brothers,  and one sister.
There was only.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oldest.
Mm-hm.
Mm   No, I think it was just  availability, I guess, would be the right word to say, at the time.
And a-  availability and affordability, right, affordability.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Ri- Mm-hm.
Um.
Yeah.
Course, I mean,  when I grew up in the s-  sixties, I mean  all neighborhoods was good because  children were disciplined back then.
Yeah.
I was  f- I'll say three.
Mm-hm.
We stayed there probably    until I was about  six maybe.
We moved to  uh,  Twin li-  Twin Lakes.
Cause we lived with my grandmother for a while.
My mom.
Right.
Mm-hm.
No, out by  Twin Lakes is before you get to Lake Park.
On.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Forty one south.
Mm-hm.
We stayed there at her house probably about    s-  I say eight.
We moved um,  um,      It's in Little Miami.
Donald- Donald street.
Donald Street is off of Statenville.
You know Statenville Hi-  Road is?
It's the street adjacent to Statenville Road.
If you going down Statenville Road before you get to uh,  the interstate , there's a little street to the right.
It's called Donald Street.
Cause most of the  uh,  people that  lived in that neighborhood during the um,  sixties, a lot of 'em   went south when it was fruit season.
And, uh, they would go there  for the fruit season and um,  pick fruits.
So that's why it became the name Little Miami, because of a lot of  people would - Yeah, a lot of kids.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, uh.
That's the only time you could play.
You never played in the house.
Just uh, you-  the boys would wrestle,  uh, if you did a combination of boys and girls, you would  play uh, like  hide and go seek.
Or the  guys would shoot marbles.
Or you would um,    create little, um,  sticks like cowboy and Indian games, or.
You would play, um    even boys jump rope  competition with the girls.
Or you play  or you can hopscotch, you know, with the little glass, and you draw your little squares out and you just toss the glass and  play hopscotch and just  if you was  if you had a  few dollars uh, a  few s-  few pennies.
You would get you some jackstone.
You know.
Yeah.
I was decent, yeah.
I m- I co-  they would choose me to play, so I guess I.
My, uh, brother that's next to-  next to me,  uh, he's four years  younger  four years younger than me.
And I have a  I have a sister that's um,  two years  younger than me.
But, my sister was  raised by my grandmother.
By her grandmother.
Okay.
Uh, and I have a baby brother who's seven years  younger than I am.
Um.
My youngest brother, he-  he's um    he lives now in, Augusta.
He retired military out the Air Force about  twenty eight years I think.
Now he works for the government.
Yeah, for s- the kids, no, you-  I mean, kids played  uh, in segments, you know, like you had  uh,  uh,  uh, I just take a range from like ten and under, like you have a ten year old,  you gonna play with the eight to ten, and then you have the, younger.
Kids mostly just  pl- they had- back then, you had  the families that would always  ha- all families had a lot of kids pretty much.
Any where from  least three to four.
unlike today where you might have one or two.
So, there was always kids around.
And they- mostly kids just play.
Teenagers play with teenagers and  children ten and under played among themselves.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I originally  um,  I started out going to  to county's  going to um,    county school when I was five years old.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was going to county school when I was a  like five year old.
So, they would let me- they would let me go to  to scho- county school.
And then we m-  um.
Transitioned back  to the city,  I couldn't go to  um,  in  for a-  I had to sit out a year.
So, I couldn't go to  first grade and I end up  I went  when I was five, I was able to go to  I was is the first grade.
But then, when I come to the city, they wouldn't let me go to the  Right.
So, I was uh, even though I could do the class work,  they say by definition, in city school, you had to be six.
So, I went to  I stayed, I-  end up staying in  the first grade  for a year.
When I really should have been in the second by definition.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
I went to school at um, South  uh, South Street Elementary School.
Which is on uh,  South Street.
On the  uh, south side of town.
That was the only  elementary school  in d-  Valdosta.
On the south side of town.
Mm.
Uh, f-  Yeah.
I did cause I- I mean ks- cause my education started at home.
My mom home-  well sh-  back then she didn't  we didn't call it home school.
But, I was-  before I was um,  even started going to school, my mama would sit down with me and  would go with different  I was mandated to have to read.
And I would have to um,  explain to her what I read,  uh,  and every morning when I wou-  went to start going to school  before I went to school every morning, my mama would go  over my school work with me.
Every subject.
Then, bef-  when I came home from school,  my mom would sit down with me before I was even allowed to go outside to play, I had to go over all my subjects again.
So,  I  we-  from my mom's standpoint, I had a  uh,  great opportunity.
You know, for schooling.
Yeah.
She.
That was her m-  that was one of the things that she promoted.
S- school.
I mean, that,  school before anything.
I went from.
I went f- um, to the fifth grade.
And in the sixth grade, I went to um,  they built a new  school on the  the south s-  south side of town, which is called South East Elementary School.
They built that school in ni- nineteen sixty nine, I think it was.
I went there for my sixth grade year.
Then I went my seventh grade year, I started at  Valosta M-  um, Junior High, they called it then, but now they call it Valdosta Middle School.
And that's when the integration started.
When I was in the seventh grade.
That's when, uh,  um,  black and white  start, they integrated the Valdosta City School system, where blacks and whites was going to the same school.
I was eleven years old.
Well, I mean sometimes it was like  tension, because it was like  cultures.
You know, you don't really know another person culture until you really  understand they culture, or try to understand it, you know, it's always confusion, you know.
But, uh,  by most part, I mean it was  it was civil, you know.
It was all black.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Right.
Mm.
Be honest with you,  I couldn't tell a difference.
Cause a- again, uh , my impact was I think- was home.
You know.
So.
Seventh and eighth grade.
Then, no.
There was um, at Pinevale,  School  they use that as a  ninth grade  for all kids.
So, you.
Black and white.
So, all bl-  black and white kids only went to junior high for two years.
And then, a-  for the ninth grade, only  all kids went to  went to Pinevale High School  before they moved over to the  Valdosta High School for tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade.
It was-  it was good.
Cause I think it-  it- it helped because you don't  get  kids  come down right be- from a junior high setting  to a high school settings.
It was like transition  of getting to  I guess grow up a little bit.
You know the you know.
Before you e- get the full thrust of, you know,  m- mingling with older kids.
You actually get the chance to, you know,  build some  I guess some nerves.
Or I mean get s- get a better foundation.
Get some grips on yourself  instead of just getting  thrust in.
Cause  I guess when you look at it, when yo- when kids sometime get go from  from one- from junior high then thrust in with the kids from ninth to twelfth grade, that's a big jump.
You know.
A big jump, so.
Right.
Just ninth grade classes  only.
I mean, we had our own football team, I mean, our own football, I mean with ninth grade football, basketball  everything would have been just like you was at the high school, but it was just like the ninth grades.
We'd play against other schools at uh,  other high school teams.
I mea- cause every school back then had ninth grades.
That they mighta not have been as separated as we were in Val- at Valdosta school system, but they still had ninth grades.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I played basketball in the ninth grade.
I played guard.
Mm-hm.
Shooting guard.
I was decent.
I started.
Yeah.
Mm-mm.
I started.
Mm-hm.
Uh.
Ninth or tenth grade, I  transitioned, and I- I didn't play sports anymore cause I w- I wanted  I was always ambitious and wanted  a car  So.
I wanted to work.
So, my cousin    uh,  mom used to pick us up  and we  uh, befriended a    young- I- uh, I call her young lady.
Still call her old la- young lady Ms.
RD-NAME-2.
And Ms.
RD-NAME-2 was like,  uh, she was a  k- over the custodians at the  school system.
So, my family knew her.
So, Ms.
RD-NAME-2 gave me and my cousin a job after school.
We was in the tenth grade, we would go after school and uh, work  Monday through Friday.
And I was able to actually, save money  toward getting a car.
It didn't take long because during the summertime,  in those days,  you had to go  out in the fields  if you wanted  income.
I mean, we don't-  no such thing as what kids now an al-  an allowance.
You had to make your allowance by working.
So, during the summer,  I would go crop tobacco and save money.
And I would even go buy my school clothes in the tenth grade.
That just something that  I just shifted it  and took control of myself.
Probably into- now, working tobacco, that was tradition  f-  for most black kids  doin-  in my age.
Probably start working the 'bacca when you was probably about in  um, about ten years old, I mean, you do some form of work.
You know, you go  to field ac- uh.
Pick peaches, uh, you would go pick beans, it was always something  that we just  as kids would go out and do in order to have our own income or just have spending money cause mama  during those days just didn't have money to t- to just ha-  give out to kids, you know.
So we just  grew up with a work ethics I guess.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Depend on what you was doing.
Like, uh,  if you like worked at the barn  which, I started working tobacco when I was about seven,  eight.
Cause my  um,    It's  Ms.
uh, RD-NAME-3  uh,  in what we call Little Miami,    which is my stepfather's uh  mom  they would,  I guess, she would call it,  they  they called it the hauling hands.
That's what they called it.
Uh.
People in the neighborhood.
Like, farmers and all, they would hire  uh, someone like beacon  uh i-  be the, I guess, um    just like now with the Hispanics,  you have someone that's actually the lead person, and then they h-  the lead person bring other people in to do the work.
Migrant work.
That's wha-  I mean, we was the extension of doing the migrant work during that time.
What the Hispanics do now.
So, she would- the people in the neighborhood that wanted to work,  they would be  more or less up under her umbrella.
And she would make sure that that we would  get the w-  the g- the guy would supply the transportation.
That he would give them a truck or whatever.
They get the hand- what they would call hands  back then.
That's the main term they used.
To go out into the fields, or, in  like,  crop tobacco and  all that stuff, so I would actually work at the barn, or what they called where the-  where the tobacco is strung.
And hung up into the barn  before it's cooked.
So, I would-  was hired to pick up leaves and like  take off sticks, uh, like the  like they was  go in the field, crop the 'bacca, then they would have what they call  handers  and stringers.
The handers were the person that handed the 'bacca to the person that was stringing it with a-  on a stick.
And once the stick is strung up  enough 'bacca on the stick to take off, you would take- I would take that stick  and take it and hand it to someone in the barn, and they would start at the top  and they would hang it all the way from the top to the bottom.
until that barn is filled.
And once that barn was filled,  then they would- l- light it with  um,   I guess kerosene back in those days.
And cook the 'bacca.
And once the 'bacca was cooked,  then  we would  take the tobacco off the stick  and put it in these big sheets  and then it would go off to the warehouse to be sold.
Well, the stinging part probably would take  one day, cause you would, uh  probably take y'all a day to fill a barn.
Based on the size it was, you would, uh,  And then they would let it cook  according how-  I would guess  two or three days sometimes, cause they added-  I guess,  not like  cook cook  well, I guess you'd I guess  had the heat on  and you just cured it until all of the uh- And what they call was um, the had to cook it at a- at a rate so the tobacco stems  which is like a-  if you looking at  uh,  collared greens, you know, the stems is thicker than the leaves.
They would have to cook it so  that it wouldn't burn the leaves up  but also would cook the te-  stems where the wouldn't  stay green.
Because,  if you took the  tobacco,  and they had green st- um, thems,  stems on it,  and mix, and mix it in the sheet, it would ruin the tobacco.
So, that was a  process they had to really watch.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah, you would.
Cause  um, most ge- most farmers,  they would have mu- multiple barns, like, you know.
Cause there were like,  seven, eight barns, cause  according to how long it took  to tobacco to  cure out because there's different levels of tobacco.
When you first start,  they call the- at the bottom of the stalk,  they would  uh.
They would-  you hafta  crop that first.
That's what they made cigars out of,  by the way.
The- the  first crop of tobacco, that's  what they made cigars out of.
And you would crop that first.
What they call sand lugs, that was the  technical name for it.
Sand lug.
Cause it was so close to the ground, that it was hid in the sand.
So they- so you was lugging that off the stalks.
So, you would crop that first, and then at-  each week,  uh,  you would go back  and as p- the weeks progressed, you would take the stalk-  you would t-  get more- more tobacco.
All the way til it go to the top.
And that's the  process of cropping tobacco.
Because it was  at the bottom, that's where it got  brown first, I mean, far as, bec-  for us, it  say ripe first.
And then, as you start  um,   cropping tobacco off the stalk  and it progressed up the next week.
The next level would be ripe, and then  just like  you-  pruning I guess.
Go from one- one green t-  so, that was the process of tobacco.
No, I did it until I like, say I- got.
No, I- I did it  probably until I was about f- about fifteen.
Mm-hm.
Then, at fifteen, I started um   working at the school,  after school In the summer, I got a job, um, at Strickland Cotton Mills.
Yeah.
Strickland Cotton Mills.
I start working there  um,  probably  my junior year.
And uh,  Yeah.
My junior year  in Valdosta High School.
I started working Strickland- I would go to Strickland Cotton Mills, I would  work  I would got to sch- wo- school all day long,  I would get off  and be a Strickland Cotton Mill at  four o'clock  and I would work a eight hour shift  five or six days a week.
At least, I would work  sometime we had to work Saturdays,  but at least, Monday through Friday, I would work  eight hours.
Just like an adult.
You know.
Uh.
After school.
It was need, I met my-  my mom  um,  to help her.
Cause  um,   I just said, um,  to help her, cause it really wasn't, I mean  conducive  sometime my dad wouldn't  do what he's supposed to do.
You.
So, you know.
And my mama had poured so much into me, you know, and I just had to  do whatever I had to do to help her.
It was out of necessity.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
I got the car in the summer  right bet- fore I went to um,  the tenth- eleventh grade.
I bought a  Cougar XL seven.
It was black  red stripes  and it was um,   because it was a-  it was automatic, but this gear shift was in the floor.
It probably  probably about fifteen hundred.
Uh.
I'd say fift-  maybe fifteen hundred dollars and I just paid  I had a down payment and it  and  when I worked during the week,  every week, I would just  go to the car lot and  pay the guy.
Uh, n- it was I mean- that year was seventy  two.
It was about four years old.
Cause it was a sixty eight.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, just going to school.
I mean and  may-  just making sure I  did my school work.
You know.
Go there- My eight hours and-  and on Sundays, um  Saturdays and Sundays and I would  actually go to church.
You know.
But, um.
I sat at-, sometime I'd go to like some of the functions, you know, like, I mean I go to s-  ba- some of the ball games and stuff, you know, like most kids.
But I was just  mostly just working.
Working and reading.
Always been an  avid reader.
And I was, um  forcing it also.
Working at Strickland,  the guy that I worked for,    uh,  And it's ironic  you know, when I tell people this, they-  they are puzzled.
He,  uh.
He told me, he said RD-NAME-1, he said, I see you um  he said he told me, you got to high school?
I say yes sir.
And he said, uh,  I never  got a chance  to go to school.
He said, but uh,  even though you working these eight hours,  he said, when you get a break,  and I already told all these- cause I was working out there with grown men.
He said, I already instructed these guys,  whenever you might not be at your  post, or whatever you're doing to help them,  that I had already authorized you to get your school work every day  while you're here at work.
You know.
If you need to take some time,  fifteen, twenty, thirty minutes, or whatever,  for your lunch break  extra.
Cause back then, you didn't even have no lunch breaks, you  you f- you'd fit in when you get a chance but,  he told me, he said I want you to-  to baby, let's get you a high school  education.
And that's a white guy telling me that and,  in nineteen seventy-  seventy three.
That- that was um,  when I look back on it now, you look at the turbulent  times we done had in this country,  that- that was remarkable to me.
And I often just reflect back on that sometime.
I say, I hope you know that-  that he encouraged me, you know.
They- that-  that even if he didn't get it,  that he thought enough  of me  wanting to get it  that he was gonna support me  and make sure I got it.
Um.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
You know, I.
Mm-hm.
That's a foreman.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I went to  in fact,  I finished high school after the eleventh grade.
When I  after eleventh grade, all I needed was English four.
Just  my senior English.
So, I went to summer school  and the  year- uh, my class is seventy-five, but  in the summer  of  nineteen seventy-four, all I needed was English.
And they was offering English  for summer school  so, I went to summer school, finished, got my English  four.
So, after the eleventh grade, I was finished with school.
And.
I worked, I continued to work at Strickland.
After that year, you know,  and then I just decided I wanted-  what can else I do?
I  mm.
I guess  I ended up going to the-  I went to the military.
And uh,  when I was in the military, I  just started thinking about you know, wh-  what I'd do in my future.
And I took some classes when I was in the military.
And then I got out of this.
Uh,  got married when I was in the military.
In uh,  after two years, and  then I had um  my first child,  was born in  nineteen seventy-nine.
And.
So, when I got out,  I just started working, I got a job at RD-WORK-1.
And I've been at RD-WORK-1 Ever since.
Yeah.
Too fast.
At the time, there was, uh  there was no outlet.
Cause I wasn't thinking about school.
I mean, I pl-  I- I know i probably coulda did the school work, but I just needed something real quick t-  I mean, a- to  to  get something going.
Cause again, I always, my thought was always about my mom, what can I do to, you know,  assist her, financially.
You know.
So, I guess that the best thing  next best thing to do that, would be  be in the military, you know.
And have a  a job,  I mean,  benefits  and so I can send my mama money, you know, to  try to help her out.
You know.
So,  that was it.
Seventy-five.
In uh, November  the fourth, nineteen seventy-five.
I stayed in the military four years.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
No, not the same wife today.
Different one.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
I have two girls.
Mm-hm.
Nineteen  April the  eleventh, Nineteen seventy-nine.
Seventy eight.
Um, excuse me.
Seven.
Seven years and two days.
August the thirteenth.
Mm.
Yeah, what- what really made me leave the military was  I was  some of the   talking to some of the veterans in the military.
And  them having to go  um,   what they call a remote tour.
And be separated from their  family,  their children,  and that's something I didn't want, cause my daughter was just born.
And I just couldn't fathom, you know  being separated from her  during the years, I mean,  one to two years old, and lose all that  possibly.
Cause I just heard all the horror stories of-  when they came back,  they really didn't have no identity, with the kids, the kids really didn't know who they was, and that's a long time.
Full year, I mean  and you really can't blame the kid, because the fact they are  you know,  basically  product of their surroundings, you know.
So, um.
I didn't wanna take that chance and I  and then again, just thinking back to  my relationship with my mom, you know  I  I jus- I just wanted to have that s-  that same strong relationship with my children, you know.
Mm-hm.
Uh.
Texas was when I went to uh, basic training.
Which was-  which was different, you know that's when you get all your instructions , you know, and then,  and it's-  it's all about, you know  uh, how you-  you know, receive it, and with my background, it  it really wasn't that  big of a deal with me, cause I'm  so u- I been used to people s-  you know, screaming  hollering, and that kind of  stuff, and it was, it's just a  part of just getting you regimented, to you know,  to make sure that you're  actually capable  of I guess  receiving instructions.
I guess it was more  gen around to make sure you gonna be able to receive instructions and, um,   and move forward.
So in my basic training- in fact, even in basic training,   I was able to um,  I was  given a position as the dorm chief  that would be over all the s- offic- over the troops, you know.
Then,  and I uh,  you know,  I wa-  I would  what they call our, uh,  TIs  technical ins-  uh, training instructors.
One was Hispanic  and um,  one was um,  Caucasian.
And we never seen those guys  they w- they- we was- they would be with us during the day,  in fact one of 'em was a, uh   the Hispanic guy was a um  what we call disc jockeys back then.
You know.
He was a disc jockey, and the other one was uh,  I forget what else he did.
But, you never really seen him.
We basically on our own  in a sense, you know.
But, uh,  and- and they do that too just to  they say, well,  y'all guys doing good.
We d- we don't need to babysit y'all, you know, just, no- you know what to do,  you know when to go to lunch, you know when to come back.
And-  and uh,   so that was definitely different.
And I got a chance to after  dra- graduating from, um,  basic training,  I was, um,   I was security police.
That was my MO.
That was the field I was in.
In security.
So, um,  my first assignment  af-  after went in the technical school, left Texas  then we stayed in Texas and went to technical school  and Lackland Air Force Base.
And I got an assignment, I was going to, uh,  South Dakota.
Ellsworth, South Dakota.
And so,  this other guy was going to, uh,  uh, which country was that?
Um.
Not the Philippines.
I forget the name of the country he was going to.
So, we s- we changed  orders.
And I said, well I-  I'd like to leave the country, I mean I-  I would like that experience, you know?
Instead of going up there in all that cold.
And he said, you'll swap with me?
And I said, uh,  yeah.
So we s-  we got  we went over to baseops  and they switched our orders, and I was gonna  go, uh,    out of the country and he was going to go to Ellsworth.
And that was right before   the  Vietnam War ended.
When they signed the peace treaty.
And that's was eliminated me from having to-  being able to go outside of the United States.
And I ended up getting as-  my orders at what they call red line.
They red lined my orders, and I ended up having to go to North Carolina.
I was in Goldsboro.
Goldsboro is-  North Carolina is about  fifty miles  east  according of what direction of what you're going in, from Charlotte, North- I mean from uh,  not Charlotte.
Ch- Charlotte's probably  two hours.
But, Rocky  I mean, um,   s-  call it, uh,  Not Rocky Fort, uh  what's the,  where Chapel Hill at?
Um.
It's about fifty miles.
Rocky Mount.
I mean, Rocky Mount  is famous for furniture.
But, Chapel Hill  where the Caroli- I mean, where the Carolina Tar Heels, um.
It's about fifty miles from there.
Yeah.
Mm.
Ninety five.
Yeah, you going up ninety five, you get to uh, Goldsboro, then you  go on about fifty miles on up,  get up  to um,  like it's right on the tip of my tongue, I can't think of the name of the town.
Uh.
By the-  my s-  it's fifty miles from there.
Yeah.
I was in North Carolina  uh,  about a little over three years, after  tech school.
After basic training and technical school.
Mm-hm.
No.
She's from Valdosta.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
It was good.
I li- I met one of the best friends, I c- still got a life time friend I met,  um.
Back in nineteen-seventy seven, we still friends.
Mm-hm.
I.
Right  Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Work.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
I-  in fact what I   what I do now, and it gr-  what I do now, I do at  it's the same thing I do, only now, I'm just  in charge of it all.
I start off as a shipping clerk.
And uh, i- d- g- the person that hired me  actually was one of the people  that moved RD-WORK-1 from the  when they was i-  RD-WORK-1 was originally was in New Jersey.
Called RD-WORK-2 in-  industries.
So, they moved  south  and built RD-WORK-1.
Now, RD-WORK-1 is a  is a French  company.
Uh,  the French company  the original  uh, company's in Bordeaux, France.
In  this year we- last year we  celebrated a hundred years in existence.
As a.
We- we make, uh  aviation batteries for all  like Boeing, Aircraft,  Golfstream Aircrafts.
Uh.
We make military, um    batteries and components.
We make  Bell South, AT&T,  uh, Verizon type batteries for the backup  systems  for power units.
We build  batteries for the New York City Transit,  uh,  trolley cars out in  California.
We build for  Bombardier trains  and  busses  Mm-hm.
Mm.
Indu- Yeah.
Industrial type.
Yeah, yeah.
Mm-hm.
Um.
At RD-WORK-1 as a whole in Valdosta?
probably about  t- between two fifty and three hundred, once you look at office  and um,  salary and hourly employees.
Mm-hm.
Uh, five.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
N- the-  shipping, receiving, and  pulling the parts for the components to be built, mm-hm.
Mm.
Not really.
Cau- cause I mean, we just do the actual  pulling the  pulling the parts and stuff.
As far as the shipping,  and uh, l- receiving, we just receive the goods in, and somebody else inspect them.
We just have to make sure what we receiving  and  lot of the- the product  this one  one of the areas   is more-  two of the areas is more just like administrative type, and just  not actually packing.
Cause those department actually pack it up.
The aviation part,  we actually  pack that part up, cause you dealing with individual batteries and stuff, but  the other parts  they're packaged, but they're packaged off a line.
Where as the aviation, you ha-  it goes through the FAA.
So, they have to be inspected  and you got to make sure you  got each boxes serialized separate to make sure you got the right batteries and all that stuff.
So, it's a little  little more complex.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Uh.
About f- f- four years maybe.
Four to five years.
Just traveling.
N- just having a good time.
Uh.
Anywhere.
Cause I mean, I travel a lot now.
But I just, um,    for my sixty third birthday,  I  plan on going to Hawaii.
And my favorite  travel place now is, I like New York.
A- I like goin- I like Manhattan.
Uh, I like Times Square.
Um.
I like-  I like the Yankees  Uh.
And I like um,  plays.
Broadway Plays.
Last year.
I went to see, um,  the play of The Yankees.
I went to-  I went to see uh,  .
I can't name.
It's a  remake of  The Wiz?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
And I went to see    I saw Gladys Knight  and the O'Jays  in concert  one night.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Uh.
Thinking about Alaska.
Just take a cruise to Alaska.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I've been, um  several cruises.
I went to Mexico  and the Baha- Yeah.
Took a seven day cruise  Mexico.
Then I took a cruise to um,  Puerto Rico, Haiti, and um,  Saint Thomas.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
We have um.
My wife  went to VSU with uh,  with a student, her name is RD-NAME-3  and she was from Mo-  Mozambique.
And she's been-  she's invited us to come  to Africa, and we  think  we gon- we gonna make it.
We gonna go.
Cause she um.
She was the smartest thing in the world.
I mean, as far as math.
And uh.
And she helped my wife a lot.
You know,  to get through  math.
And  more or less, she started calling me daddy RD-NAME-1 and mama RD-NAME-2.
So.
Her parents came over.
In fact,  when she got ready to move,  um,  my  company allowed me to um,  pack her stuff up  and uh, ship it over to Africa.
Yeah.
At a discount.
On the company's discount.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
No, um.
I guess m-  my c- I had a couple guys I-  my cousin, my first cousin and I was good friends,  and then we had another friend, but.
I had a-  I always been um, liking a lo- hm.
Uh.
Gun-slinger like,  lone ra- uh, single  guy.
Fact,  You know what.
Something my grandaddy shared with me.
He said,    when I got my car, he said,  son, I'm'a give you some good advice.
He said, see that door over there?
I say, yes sir.
He said  you can keep it locked, or you can keep it open.
He said, lemme give you an illustration.
He said, in the wild, wild west,   they had    what they called shotgun riders  on the stage coach  in order to protect the-  the person that's driving.
He said, now you don't-  you can protect yourself by keeping that door locked on the other side.
He saw the s- or he'd say, be careful who you let sit in that seat on the other side.
So,  I-  I  always just been that-  My mom was  more of like  a  loner.
I mean I  guess you-  um.
I guess you  like a loner, just.
And I- I-  I feel comfortable just-  just having my own space.
I- I don't li-  I don't really enjoy crowds that much.
To a certain extent,  I can enjoy it for a while, and then I just have to get back in my comfort zone.
You know?
Yeah, his name is RD-NAME-4.
I met AJ- AJ  as um.
His mom, Ms.
RD-NAME-2  and he had a sister named RD-NAME-2.
And AJ lived about  Kinston, North Carolina.
If you've heard of Kinston.
But, Kinston is about  twenty five miles from Goldsboro.
And he was able to-  he was in the military.
He was from Kinston  but, he got stationed at Goldsboro.
So, he was right there at home.
So, I met him and he said, man I'm gonna introduce you to my mom and my um,   sister.
Cause his dad died when he was I think- AJ was  um,  probably about  f-  three or four.
Something like that when his dad died.
And, um,  I met his mom,  and um became good friends with her and, um,  and she always told me, she said, you're always welcome,  you know, even when if RD-NAME-2's not here.
You know.
There's a room, you know, you come, stay if you in t-  town, or whatever, you don't wanna go back to the base, you know.
You always welcome in.
So I bec-  befriended them.
They f- I guess they befriended me.
And  I was  friends with him and his s- what' different is him and his sister.
Keep in touch with 'em, texting 'em all the time.
Just  checking on them, cause his mom  passed,  about f-  I think my mom passed in twenty-fifteen.
So, his mom  think  passed in twenty-fourteen I think.
And, um,  So, we just been good friends over the years and.
RD-NAME-2 got in some trouble.
Once we got out of m-  military.
And I would, um-  He had two boys.
And I had two girls.
And um.
I would always, you know,  ta- I mean send stuff for him.
You know,  just cheering him wife and stuff, you know and- and And that's what friends do.
Do.
You know.
Wasn't nothing that they had to ask, you know, I just knew that  The- they was gonna have needs, you know.
So,    just always try to work them in to where I-  what I had, you know?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
No.
No, I never experienced that.
Um.
You know d- t-  it might be  sk-  crazy or strange,  but,    when my mom died, it was  I mean, that's expectations.
There a sense as a kid, you know your parents are older than you are.
My dad died.
Pretty much.
My brother died in November  last year.
And that's been the most traumatizing thing to me  in my life.
And I- and I-  And I guess I assess it back to  I knew  uh.
When I was speaking at the funeral,   I got assess it back to  I could just remember my mom  praying with my brother.
And uh.
And throughout the years, I can remember my mama always just  telling me, you know, even when he was smaller,  you know, that uh,  take care of him.
You know, and.
And back then, those the  back in them-  when I grew up,  we kids  when your parents went off,  you know, the-  the oldest was always left in charge.
You know.
And um,  And my mom would come home, and she would say, well how di- how did he do today?
And- an-  and I would always say, mama, he did good, even though he didn't, you know?
Cause.
I was, uh,  my brother had that Frank Sinatra  mentality, he's just gonna do it his way.
So, I would always cover for him, and I guess  his whole life, even h- he-  he went down a path that, um,  that I didn't go down, as far as  things he shouldn't have g-  got involved with, you know, and-  and that was just- just his choice.
You know?
And um.
And.
And I've just.
That's  that's been the hardest thing on me.
My-  my- my baby- my young brother.
uh, I s-  if you s-  speaking of traumatizing, in a sense,  is death.
It's been the  most  traumatize thing to me I ever dealt with.
November the fifth.
Mm-hm.
Twenty-eighteen.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, my brother, um,   My brother got involved with    with drugs.
And um.
He-  heart conditions.
And n-  he never really  fully s-  committed to  doing  treating himself better.
You know.
He was-  kept  playing the victim.
You know, versus investing  in- in himself, you know.
There was a way out,  better way out, but  he never did.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
So.
Hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Um.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Uh.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Wow.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Well, yeah.
Well, yeah.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
.
Yeah.
I could remember as a kid, growing up.
Um.
It was crazy.
But you know what?
Prior to integration,   you know where the overpass is now?
Valdo- Mm.
The one  overpass downtown.
What we called  beneath the overpass was Crane Avenue.
Right there where  the old- I mean the unemployment office and all that stuff is now.
All those businesses,  all that  space down there was black owned businesses.
And,  black people describe, describe  back in those days, cause  basically  our money  made it's- made surplus within the neighborhood.
You know?
Versus  now,  know, we just consumers.
You know?
We-  we don't own nothing.
Our money just spend it  lo- it's spent in one t-  spent out, it never spends in, you know  within the community.
So, um    Even though we was  separate,  they was better off  in a s- in a sense, cause  now, this is just my philosophy.
Integration,  I think we look at it  um    we didn't  actually understand the extent of what  integration was doing to us.
I think it,  um,    from a economic standpoint,  and-  and it's always about economics.
You know.
That I mean the- You know.
A- and And I th-  guess  wh- when you've been shut out so much of  what you've perceived  to be, um,  validated  as a people,  um, you go from  being kidnapped,  to being,  you know,  bought over here  and being enslaved  and  you being  told you was free, but you're not free.
And then you s-  y- y- you still within your own  communities.
k-  I mean, you're not really mingling with the other-  other  people.
We-  we bought a sense of  integration as  acceptance.
I guess we had to be accepted.
For someone to just verbally tell you that you accept, that you can come in the restaurant, you can do this, you can do that.
But then, at the same time,  when that acceptance came, we gave up  our strength,  which was our economics.
You know.
Um.
Even our  cultures in the school  s- school system.
When- when the schools integrated,  you can't go back and,  unless you was  um,  from my age on up,  know anything about Pinevale.
The history of Pinevale.
The history of Westside high school.
It's all about Lowndes.
It's all about Valdosta.
But, there was a history prior to those schools.
Which was, Westside was a county school,  and Val- I mean, Pinevale was a city school.
But,  all that history  is gone.
Wiped out.
And is nonexistent.
Unless you like I said, unless you was-  my age or older, doesn't know that those things existed.
And, by the same token, when it comes to, um,  economics in Valdosta,  wasn't a lot of money, but if you look at the stores,  the stores that you see in Valdosta now.
We-  we don't wanna populate those stores in our community  economically.
But, we don't own none of 'em.
You know?
But, back then, those same stores,  was owned by us.
So, you was able to,  uh, go in those stores  in the community, the ladies know you, the men know you.
And so, i- it was a-  we was more economically  um,  intense  back then  versus now.
Because now,  all we, like I said, all we all the  consumers.
And when they built that overpass,  and if you go in any major city in this country,  Savannah, anywhere.
And you  can  talk to anyone in those communities,  when those overpass was built,  it just  the-  the  decline  of the black communities in those areas,  just  went down, stores and everything.
But the-  but, as far as integration goes,  overall,  I think that's the- been the biggest clux.
But,  far as  seeing the signs and all that stuff, to me,  even now, y- you  I  always been  could just  people could say  you can see all these signs, and I mean, you can s- you can see all this stuff,  but,  again, it has to get back to the-  to the individual person.
The- e-  what a-  what a person s-  what a person say, don't really have to make you-  you don't have to be that.
You know?
I think sometime we- we, um,  we-  we take on  another person poison.
when we shouldn't  because,  what a person say about you don't define you.
But, you can take what that person say about you and get so engrossed in it  that it becomes  part of you.
In- instead of you in-  instead of you  moving a nege-  on entertaining negative,  my mama always told me,  RD-NAME-1, you have one responsibility,  that's how you treat people.
How they treat you is not your responsibility.
You don't act on that.
You act on  positive.
You always entertain positive.
The negative,  you know it's negative,  don't entertain that.
Invest in your positive.
If you invest in your positive, you gonna invest in you.
you not gonna get a return out a  negative.
but you gonna get one out of a positive.
So,  don't entertain negative.
You know?
It's not your responsibility.
Just do what you know the right thing to do.
You'll be better off, no matter what you see going on around you.
She said,  it always come back to you, you got to invest in yourself.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I try- that's my first thought every day.
Praying to my God.
And  taking in,  insight what my mama always told me.
It's not  I bl- I-  I-  I had a concept that if anybody gonna be hurt,  I can take it.
Let it be me.
If you-  if you have to cast your  ugliness  l-  toward me, that's fine.
But the-  I just  I won't never  cast my positive  which is positive  towards you for ha-  for negative.
Mm-hm.
Uh, somewhat.
My mom was always involved with church, I-  I was in church,  but I mean, you-  you sort of  as you get older, you sort of, you know, st- stray away from it, but you know.
But, I- I am  a  big proponent of-  of church.
Probably you might have been the sixth grade, maybe.
Junior?
What year?
I don't know.
No, I think you wa- Mm-hm.
I met you at Antioch.
You was probably in junior high school maybe?
Uh.
Gra- yeah.
Fifth grade.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Long.
Mm-hm.
My original church was Antioch.
I mean uh,  Hosanna.
That's my mom and them church Down in Lake Park.
Um.
My wife church.
That was they family church.
Mm-hm.
I'm a m-  um, church at Pine Hill.
Um.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
I would list  to the world, What my mom always told me.
I have one responsibility  of how I treat people.
Not how they treat me.
That's-  That's the greatest  other than  my savior  that's the greatest advice I would k- I received.
And it's always been a-  it's been a, um,  stabling force in my life.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
