Um, okay.
Well so we can get started officially.
So, um,  I'm RD-NAME-4 and I'm talking to RD-NAME-3, tell me your last name again?
RD-NAME-1.
Hi RD-NAME-3.
Um, I'm good.
So I normally ask people just sort of start at the beginning of their lives.
So could you tell me when and where you were born?
Okay.
This same apartment?
That's amazing.
Um, can you tell me a little bit about your family and their history?
Like, how did they end up in Brooklyn and then here?
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Where in Brooklyn was this?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Do you- and you still have family that live there?
So why did, um,  you guys decided to move here?
Nineteen eighty-four, yeah.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Oh, you were?
I love these style- the- these NYCHA buildings, because they're so small.
So it f- It doesn't feel like a big- you know, living in like a big, huge tower.
It just seems like it must be nice.
Right.
Cause you don't have  people just wandering through.
If someone turns down here, they probably live here.
Or know someone here, yeah.
I actually have a friend who lives right across the street.
Yeah.
So I've- I've been- I- it's- I've been down this block,  believe it or not.
But it's very quiet.
It's great.
You did?
Yeah.
What are some of the other games that you remember playing?
Yeah.
I- I think so.
But tell me- maybe the rules are different, tell me.
Yeah.
Oh.
So it was a block thing?
Okay.
So where- what- where would you hide?
Would you go like, inside someone's apartment?
Okay.
No building.
Like, under a car or?
You have the backyards, right.
Okay.
Okay.
So if you got caught, you had to join the- the team of the finders?
Got it.
Yeah.
And I'd slowly try to find everybody else?
Okay.
You had to go to prison?
Oh.
So did they have- so one of the teams to leave, like, guards?
This is complicated.
That sounds fun.
So you have backyards on both sides?
Y- you had access to both?
Like how did you get- Oh, okay.
That's nice.
Use it.
Right, right.
I've seen the- the backyard.
There's another, uh,  uh, NYCHA,  um,  where is it?
On Sixth Street, between like, C and D or something that- it- same layout, small buildings.
I saw the backyards are so nice.
Oh, really?
I couldn't believe it.
I was like, oh my God.
I didn't even know that this existed.
They do?
Wow.
And you mentioned you played basketball, where did you play?
Oh you did?
Oh.
That's too bad.
Yeah.
So it sounds like you played  on the block.
And this is actually a nice block because it's not a through street.
So you probably could play actually on, like out on the street and things like that.
Oh.
Right.
Yeah.
But then you would also play at- in other places.
Like go to the park, go to Tompkins Square other things like that?
That's cool.
Right.
Yeah.
So you d- um, you mentioned, I think, two siblings?
You have three.
Wow, that's great.
D- Do they all still live in the neighborhood or?
Where was he before that?
Oh, okay.
Huh.
Cool.
And, um, did you know your father?
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's- that's a shame.
And did he live with you guys before that?
Aw.
Oh.
Yeah.
Sorry to hear that.
Um, and- and so as you were growing up, I'm just curious, what your parents, you know, did for a living.
Were they both working?
Oh, wow.
Oh no.
Can I ask what you were- When you- when you were like, a little kid?
Oh, I'm sorry.
How does asthma work?
Is that like a genetic- something that's genetic, or?
Huh.
Or like, combination or both or something.
Yeah.
I wonder if it's too, like, if you're exposed to something?
Like, I don't know, asbestos or in a school or something like that?
Oh.
Yeah.
So they don't know- .
Oh.
So what was your mom doing in the World Trade Center?
Oh.
And so then- then she came home to stay with you?
Wow.
In the neighborhood?
Oh, okay.
Oh.
S- well that must've been hard, playing all these games if you had asthma.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But were you able to, you know, you had your- your medication and things like that.
You were still able to run around and play and things like that.
Yeah.
Wow.
I'm so sorry.
How often did it happen that you would have an asthma attack?
Like everyday?
Oh.
You did?
Oh my gosh.
And look at you now.
Yeah.
Well that's terrific.
What- I mean,  why would they say that?
A- n- asthma's not normally a- like a m- um, disease where you would pass away, right?
So you would get sick?
Just  anything.
Oh, man.
Wow.
Um,   I'm sorry to hear that.
It sounds like you d- d- d- still did okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sure.
Yeah.
That's heavy.
Yeah.
But it sounds like you dealt with it really positively.
That's great.
Um,  what else do you remember about  the block or the neighborhood at the time that you were growing up?
W- what like- what was it like?
Yeah.
What do you remember about it?
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
W- what were the stores?
Like, what- That's right.
Y- yeah.
Just to- just candy.
That's awesome.
Yeah.
Huh.
Like video games?
That's cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You'd go back to visit.
Yeah.
And it was different in Bed-Stuy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So here there were- oh, so you mentioned the people were different, so like, what was the, you know-  I don't know,  ethnic, racial make up when you were growing up?
I'm sure it's different now.
Right.
Yeah.
Really happy.
Yeah.
like kids are just Playing.
That's great.
And what about, like, the black or African American community here?
Was it- like who were your friends?
Were they, you know, were they a mix, or?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
To everyone else.
That's cool.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
You wanted to go to a more diverse place.
Yeah, that is- that would make sense.
Now did that,  um,  so it sounds like you sort of felt like there was a lot of tolerance in the neighborhood, that there weren't-  I don't know, tensions based on- yeah.
At least not for you.
Yeah.
Cause it's starting.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
So you just have to kind of roll with it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Mm-hm.
Sure.
Yeah.
Right.
And they might not realize what- what their presence is  kind of- how it affects other people around them.
Yeah, I think that is a- that's a really good point.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bring in somebody.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's really frustrating.
The real estate, , industry or whatever it is.
Yeah, yeah.
Um, let me ask you real quick just about, uh, your schooling history.
So did you go to schools in the neighborhood?
What's your, like- I wanna hear it.
Okay.
Okay.
So it's close.
But you were nervous.
Yeah.
It's scary.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Cool.
Oh, yeah.
Where is that?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Is that the high school that has, um, that great yard?
With the, like, skate park and- yes.
I always walk by there and I'm like, that looks awesome.
Was that there when you were there?
That's too bad.
So what did- a- did you like those- so you went there from seventh through twelfth?
How did you like it?
Really?
How come?
Where did they go?
Yeah.
Less school, more- more other stuff.
She still wouldn't.
Because that was  just different?
Or was it- Oh it was?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's hard.
Mm-hm.
Cool.
Cool.
That's neat.
No, not at all.
Do we need to get it?
Oh.
Oh, okay.
No, no, it's fine.
Don't worry at all.
So it was- there was like, an expectation that you would continue.
Yeah.
That's terrific.
Nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's so important.
Huh.
Yeah, that's- It sounds great.
That's great.
So you did poetry, what else were you interested in?
Basketball.
Okay.
Oh.
Yeah.
But you played it as a h- as a hobby?
Cool.
Oh.
That's great.
Wow, you did a lot.
That's so great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's so wonderful.
And so what did y- you do afterwards?
I was gonna guess you went to college.
They prepared you well.
How did you like that?
Yeah.
Did you live there?
That's- yeah, that's too far to commute really.
Yeah.
This is not what I expected.
That's funny.
Oh, really?
It was, and not a lot of people from the city?
Okay.
So you started to like it better as the years went on?
Wow.
Mm-hm.
That's great.
That's terrific.
In what?
Cool.
Two thousand eight.
That's recently.
That's terrific.
So what do you, uh, what are you up to now?
What do you wanna do and.
Yeah, you mentioned that.
How did you get involved in that?
Great time to finish.
Yeah.
Okay.
So for a year you worked- .
Oh, okay.
Oh, okay.
So you were her what?
What was that position?
Cool.
That's great.
Did you like it?
I can imagine.
What district?
Wow.
Mm-hm, yeah.
Yeah.
Was that of this year?
So, um, did you decide to leave or what happened?
You don't have to say.
You don't have to say.
You definitely knew what you were doing.
Aw.
Oh God.
That's dramatic.
Oh, and that probably made it worse.
How?
So this was all recent.
So- so what's your next step?
What do you- you are?
Uh-huh.
Who are you working with?
Oh, that's so cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She was very popular.
So you think you wanna stay in this kind of arena?
Working in city politics?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
That's great.
Um, maybe I can switch gears and- and just ask you a little bit more about how you've seen the neighborhood  change in, uh, in your twenty-four- well, twenty-one years here.
You- we talked a little bit about it, but, you know, what- what else comes to mind when you think of how you've seen it,  you know, change over time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not necessarily.
Yeah.
there's like, a boutique that sells like two hundred dollar shirts or something like- yeah.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
It's a shift.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Some- some sort of way to control a little bit of what's happening.
Not that you're against it, but that there's- you've seen some of the n- these negative effects of gentrification and things like that.
Now, a lot of people talk- you know, have seen a s-  i-  this neighborhood- this area right here has seen a lot of gentrification, you know, Avenue A and kind of moving now over.
And, um   so much so that's sometimes when I interview people, it's interesting  through all-  e- all over the Lower East Side- remember I told you this is the Lower East Side Project.
They will  define the Lower East Side  a little differently and they sometimes think of this as a separate neighborhood, so I'm curious  what you think.
Like, if I asked you how- w- what do you think the Lower East Side is in g- geo- geographically?
Like, what- where does it go?
You know, what are the little like cross streets that make up this neighborhood?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So how, like, how north does it go, like how far north would you go?
Like, f- well first of all you think you live in the Lower East Side?
You're on Fifth.
So, like, how no- would you go?
Like to Fourteenth Street or to?
Okay.
And then east of that, like First Ave- Second Ave- that's- and then what about moving south?
Do you cross Houston?
Do you cross Delancey?
S- go south, okay.
Yeah, Grand Street.
That's the Lower East Side for you?
Okay.
And then what about, like,  east of there, because you've got Chinatown- do you- is- does that seem part of Lower East Side or it's separate?
Okay.
Okay.
So- and that's growing, so that's kind of the boundaries of where- yeah.
It's funny, everyone I ask has a totally different  definition of  what the Lower East Side is, which is really interesting to me.
Um,  but, so I'm curious if- so say we use your, uh, your definition of the- the boundaries, w-  um,  do you think that all the people that live in, you know, from Fourteenth Street to Grand and the river to Avenue A, or whatever it is, um,  do they make up a community?
And I guess I have to ask you to, like, define what's community to you?
You know, like, what does it mean for people who live in an area to be a community, and not just people who live next to each other.
This block?
Very small for a community, yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You interact with.
You know.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
