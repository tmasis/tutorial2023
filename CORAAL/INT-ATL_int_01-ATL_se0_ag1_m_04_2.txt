Okay.
We rolling back again.
Yeah, yeah, so  you twenty-nine,  you're a god.
Let's see- um,  and  let's see, we was talking about something in the image.
Why you don't have any kids right now?
You's a realist, boy.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Man, we n- we need more people like you, man.
I swear I- if I heard somebody else  give that type of response for that question,  I would feel perf-  personally okay  with, you know, the state of everything.
But I don't see  enough of that.
And  I be thinking like, damn, maybe I gotta get on this bitch  just so I can  give that type of answer because it's some real niggas out here, and I don't-  some of this stuff, I don't see  represents me  thoroughly I would say,  especially when it comes to  some of these Atlanta rappers' mindsets.
You know,  I just  go back to that just cause that's kind of the industry I'm dealing with at the moment.
But, um,  yeah, it's- it's definitely  refreshing to hear that.
You never, um, thought that, um, coming across too smart might,  um, enable you or  s- be to your detriment of your music career?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Um,  I know you mentioned something about  your pops.
What about, um,  just your whole immediate family  altogether?
What's that  relationship hitting on?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Mm.
Damn, so, uh, um,    doing the music shit,  do you feel like  you be, um, at times I guess too focused on that and then you forget about I guess your personal relationships with your family or whoever,  friends,  anything like that?
Okay.
You-  you putting the right attention then on it.
Okay.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Sheesh.
Great analogy.
Okay, they gonna love this interview.
I know I had, um, a couple-  I had to interview a couple different  type of people, different walks of earth.
You know, I try to keep it  within the Black community.
That's the demographic I'm aiming for, but  it's so many different type of Black people out here,  different type of all people.
But I'm definitely noticing  just in the Atlanta area, it's a lot of different  types of Black people walking around here.
Mm.
So what about, um, food-wise?
What's- um,  what are your go-to foods  that you dine on?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh, okay, so you not- um,  you not all the way vegetarian or vegan or nothing like that?
I mean, nobody had done been, um, coming to you tryna push that  narrative on you?
They- they know you missed the barbecue or mildew.
Okay.
I know that.
Mm.
What about, um,  new projects in the future?
Whatchu, um,  thinking about?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Ay.
Okay, I get it.
I get it.
Mm-hm.
Ooh, I'm always gonna be relevant.
You talking some shit right now, but it's factual.
It's all the way real, especially- Mm.
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Nah, I feel you.
We are.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm,  inspire?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
You looking at people like Drake and Kendrick.
Ooh, okay.
Bigger than  that now.
That's a great great way to look at it.
Mm-hm.
It hasn't happened yet.
Oh my gosh.
Mm-hm.
Woo hoo hoo.
Yeah, that is a- a nice little- Mm-hm.
Hoo, okay.
So let's say  your words  as of right now  was good enough to  I guess get your-  your marketing pushed like how you would want it to, and  your single drop  in  cover to wherever.
Just off your words alone, what would you feel  need to be, I guess  mandatory  in your  dro- n-  when you drop the sign  or whatever?
What's just some- couple of media-  I mean, uh, marketing tactics that you would like to see on your behalf?
Okay.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
You, um, definitely was the first person to mention, um, Derez De'Shon name to me.
That mighta been a couple months ago maybe.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, you wo- you woulda thought he was kind of, um,  a little bit too real for some of his stuff to pop, but  I guess  with good marketing, some of the other stuff he had going along with it and word of mouth and it's his time.
Mm.
That's normal.
Shit.
That's a thing.
Nah, definitely.
Mm-hm.
Nah, we can't have the hiding, man.
Gotta be out there, man.
Yeah.
I ain't gonna lie, man, you gotta be a certain type of ivi- individual to really- really not dim your light and  keep- cause that sign is really crushing  all the indie  promotion-wise for a bunch of different shit, you know,  and you consistent with it,  you know,  and you gonna stand out.
Like a lot of times I don't even be wanting to  step out the house cause I feel like, oh shit, I'm-  I'm losing more than I'm gaining, gas, money, and  just being out,  god damn probably gonna have to pay for some drinks,  food, gas, some of everything,  you know, just kick it with folks, but  shit, you got your name.
You got that sign.
You in the place to be  even just walking down the street.
And you never thought like oh man, this shit's lame.
Ain't nobody else doing it, or blah blah blah.
Mm.
Yeah, yeah, one was a rapper, and one was a nobody, and both of 'em said, nah, that ain't really the way like that.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Okay.
I mean, you can but you wouldn't be too successful with it.
Mm-hm.
That's deep, man.
I b- I-  I always, um,  you know, appreciated the light,  but now, I b-  I notice myself  really appreciating the darkness,  and- gotta appreciate both.
Okay.
Let's see.
I'll probably, um,  speak on a few more things and wrap it up.
Um,  who you got this year (breathy  Super Bowl?
Fuck the Super Bowl.
Have you even been watching football like that?
What, you mean it's set up as in  it's too obvious for you to notice that it's set up, or- Okay, what is it about his greatness  that you're willing to question,  but Michael Jordan's greatness, I ain't hear nobody saying, oh, man,  this shit rigged for Michael Jordan to god damn win all these titles.
It look like he went out there and just snatched them hoes.
So why you saying  that Tom Brady is possibly not  doing that?
Or Bill Belichick?
Mm.
You think the Falcons really was supposed to possibly  win if it wasn't for no other extra influence on the game?
Taking it that far?
Mm-hm.
How rigged is rigged?
Like if that's the case, then the whole everything is rigged from  top to bottom every second.
You don't feel like that-  that's the case with the- um,  the NBA?
Ah.
Mm-hm.
Oh, okay.
Black quarterback come in in this bitch, he gonna have some work to do.
Cam, Vic, all those .
Okay, well d- shit  who you got for the finals then  in the NBA?
Or is it just another collision course with whoever with the Warriors?
Mm, mm, mm, mm.
I'm still happy for KD and that move he made.
It's a little funky right now, but, you know,  they gonna be testing soon.
It's gonna be some more talent.
You got Houston out there.
You gonna see people- Point triple doubles and shit.
Oh my god, that's amazing.
Yeah, think I'm'a, um,  go ahead and, um,  wrap this one up, man.
RD-NAME-2 it's- it's been a pleasure,  you know.
Hope that we  have a open invitation any time  to get a interview from you.
Definitely, man.
Well this  RD-NAME-4  signing out.
Alright one.
