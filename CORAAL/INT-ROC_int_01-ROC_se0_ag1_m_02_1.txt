But, um, oh, okay, uh, do you consent to doing this interview with me?
Ok, great.
Um,  so, uh, if you see me look down a couple times, it's just so I can get a sense of what time it is, and, yeah, stuff like that.
Um, again, the questions are pretty open-ended.
So,  you could take it  where you would like.
Um,  but the first question I usually start off with is asking people where in Rochester did they grow up.
Mm.
Okay, what was that neighborhood like?
Or how would you describe it for somebody who maybe wasn't from Rochester?
Yeah.
And, um, who were your friends in the neighborhood?
Yeah.
And what was like the thing to do?
Like, what did y'all get into?
I'm surprised I ain't seen you.
You know I went to RD-SCHOOL-1 School.
I did not at all, like, that's crazy.
You know I went there from like kindergarten to eighth grade, like.
Yeah.
That whole time.
So what schools did you go to then?
Right,  yeah.
Um,  well, what were RD-SCHOOL-3 and RD-SCHOOL-2 like?
No, I haven't.
I know.
I know.
I gotta put it on the list.
Was it intense cause of like school work you mean?
Or like, more strict?
Well, how would you- what was tha- okay, but, coming from these other schools when you got to RD-SCHOOL-2,  what was that like?
Stressful.
Yeah.
And so, at RD-SCHOOL-2,  what was your major again?
Theater, right.
Right.
I don't know why I, uh, pinned you with uh, crochet.
Well,  creative writing I would have saw you more in my classes.
That's why I- Yeah.

I was just like,  I guess I thought you was drawing and stuff.
But now that I think b- now that you say that, I think back.
I'm like no, you were an actor, like.

How do you feel like it changed you?
Like- Mm-hm.

Okay, and so,  as an artist, um, and specifically as a rapper, what do you feel like is your  aesthetic or your style?
Like what do you rap about,  what do people know you for?
Mm-hm.
Yeah and, um,  do you feel like you identify more with, uh, East Coast rappers, or  it doesn't matter?
No, I'm- I'm not, I'm really curious.
Cause I talked to a couple rappers and so that's why I'm- Okay so you associate the mumble with more, so- Yeah.

Do you have any like, long-term goals that you wanna see for  your music?

Um,  okay I guess I can ask some more  general questions about Rochester.
Um,  what  aspects of Rochester do you love and, you know, what aspects do you think need work?
Okay.
Mm-hm.

Particularly black  people who live in the city.
Mm-hm.
What do you see yourself as?
More of a street dude?
Is it- ho- is that how you would describe yourself, or?

There may not be, to you, but,  I'm curious.
Hm.
Interesting.
What they be saying?
Gabrielle Union.
Yeah, so there aren't really stereotypes.
Mm.
Yeah.
Okay,  well,  this'll be my last set of questions.
They're more so, uh, a way to ask about language, um, and that is about whether or not,  um,  you think, or people have told you Rochesterians have a accent  or talk funny.
You know,  things like that  when you maybe go other places, or.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Yeah, is there any New York slang you think that we do take  though?
Like,  I don't know, son, mad.
I know like deadass.
